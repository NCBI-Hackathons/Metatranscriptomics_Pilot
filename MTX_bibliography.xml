The response regulator, RegA, is composed of an N-terminal receiver domain linked to a C-terminal cAMP-phosphodiesterase domain. RdeA may be a phospho-transfer protein that supplies phosphates to RegA. We show genetically that phospho-RegA is the activated form of the enzyme in vivo, in that the predicted site of aspartate phosphorylation is required for full activity. We show biochemically that RdeA and RegA communicate, as evidenced by phospho-transfer between the two proteins in vitro. Phospho-transfer is dependent on the presumed phospho-accepting amino acids, histidine 65 of RdeA and aspartate 212 of RegA, and occurs in both directions. Phosphorylation of RegA by a heterologous phospho-donor protein activates RegA phosphodiesterase activity at least 20-fold. Our results suggest that the histidine phosphotransfer protein, RdeA, and the response regulator, RegA, constitute two essential elements in a eukaryotic His-Asp phospho-relay network that regulates Dictyostelium development and fruiting body maturation.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.jbc.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jbc.org/content/274/39/27379</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SRKHS5TZ\Thomason et al. - 1999 - The RdeA-RegA System, a Eukaryotic Phospho-relay C.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10488068</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\7MQK8I2Z\Thomason et al. - 1999 - The RdeA-RegA System, a Eukaryotic Phospho-relay C.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-06-25 13:57:41</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schaller, G.

In our case, we look for potential promoter regulatory elements in the upstream region of coexpressed genes. Here we present two modifications of the original Gibbs sampling algorithm for motif finding (Lawrence et al., 1993). First, we introduce the use of a probability distribution to estimate the number of copies of the motif in a sequence. Second, we describe the technical aspects of the incorporation of a higher-order background model whose application we discussed in Thijs et al. (2001). Our implementation is referred to as the Motif Sampler. We successfully validate our algorithm on several data sets. First, we show results for three sets of upstream sequences containing known motifs: 1) the G-box light-response element in plants, 2) elements involved in methionine response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and 3) the FNR O(2)-responsive element in bacteria. We use these data sets to explain the influence of the parameters on the performance of our algorithm. Second, we show results for upstream sequences from four clusters of coexpressed genes identified in a microarray experiment on wounding in Arabidopsis thaliana. Several motifs could be matched to regulatory elements from plant defence pathways in our database of plant cis-acting regulatory elements (PlantCARE). Some other strong motifs do not have corresponding motifs in PlantCARE but are promising candidates for further analysis.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12015892</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hall, Brenda P.</author><author>Shakeel, Samina N.</author><author>Amir, Madiha</author><author>Ul Haq, Noor</author><author>Qu, Xiang</author><author>Schaller, G.

Subfamily 1 members ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 (ETR1) and ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1 (ERS1) have histidine kinase activity, unlike the subfamily 2 members ETR2, ERS2, and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE4 (EIN4), which lack amino acid residues critical for this enzymatic activity. To resolve the role of histidine kinase activity in signaling by the receptors, we transformed an etr1-9;ers1-3 double mutant with wild-type and kinase-inactive versions of the receptor ETR1. Both wild-type and kinase-inactive ETR1 rescue the constitutive ethylene-response phenotype of etr1-9;ers1-3, restoring normal growth to the mutant in air. However, the lines carrying kinase-inactive ETR1 exhibit reduced sensitivity to ethylene based on several growth response assays. Microarray and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses of gene expression support a role for histidine kinase activity in eliciting the ethylene response. In addition, protein levels of the Raf-like kinase CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1), which physically associates with the ethylene receptor ETR1, are less responsive to ethylene in lines containing kinase-inactive ETR1. These data indicate that the histidine kinase activity of ETR1 is not required for but plays a modulating role in the regulation of ethylene responses. Models for how enzymatic and nonenzymatic regulation may facilitate signaling from the ethylene receptors are discussed.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22467798</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sweere, U.</author><author>Eichenberg, K.</author><author>Lohrmann, J.</author><author>Mira-Rodado, V.</author><author>Bäurle, I.</author><author>Kudla, J.</author><author>Nagy, F.</author><author>Schafer, E.</author><author>Harter, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interaction of the response regulator ARR4 with phytochrome B in modulating red light signaling</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title><abbr-1>Science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1108-1111</pages><volume>294</volume><number>5544</number><issue>5544</issue><keywords><keyword>Arabidopsis</keyword><keyword>Arabidopsis Proteins</keyword><keyword>Genes, Plant</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Plants, Genetically Modified</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Cell Nucleus</keyword><keyword>Cytoplasm</keyword><keyword>Darkness</keyword><keyword>Light</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Photoreceptor Cells</keyword><keyword>Phytochrome</keyword><keyword>Phytochrome B</keyword><keyword>Protein Conformation</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Two-Hybrid System Techniques</keyword><keyword>Yeasts</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>Nov 2, 2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0036-8075</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1065022</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Arabidopsis thaliana response regulator 4, expressed in response to phytochrome B action, specifically interacts with the extreme amino-terminus of the photoreceptor. The response regulator 4 stabilizes the active Pfr form of phytochrome B in yeast and in planta, thus elevates the level of the active photoreceptor in vivo. Accordingly, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the response regulator 4 display hypersensitivity to red light but not to light of other wavelengths. We propose that the response regulator 4 acts as an output element of a two-component system that modulates red light signaling on the level of the phytochrome B photoreceptor.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11691995</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hutchison, Claire E.</author><author>Li, Jie</author><author>Argueso, Cristiana</author><author>Gonzalez, Monica</author><author>Lee, Eurie</author><author>Lewis, Michael W.</author><author>Maxwell, Bridey B.</author><author>Perdue, Tony D.</author><author>Schaller, G.

A phosphorelay pathway is the current model for cytokinin signaling. To assess the role of AHPs in cytokinin signaling, we isolated T-DNA insertions in the five AHP genes that are predicted to encode functional HPts and constructed multiple insertion mutants, including an ahp1,2,3,4,5 quintuple mutant. Single ahp mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type seedlings in cytokinin response assays. However, various higher-order mutants displayed reduced sensitivity to cytokinin in diverse cytokinin assays, indicating both a positive role for AHPs in cytokinin signaling and functional overlap among the AHPs. In contrast with the other four AHPs, AHP4 may play a negative role in some cytokinin responses. The quintuple ahp mutant showed various abnormalities in growth and development, including reduced fertility, increased seed size, reduced vascular development, and a shortened primary root. These data indicate that most of the AHPs are redundant, positive regulators of cytokinin signaling and affect multiple aspects of plant development.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17122069</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moreira, Sofia</author><author>Bishopp, Anthony</author><author>Carvalho, Helena</author><author>Campilho, Ana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>AHP6 inhibits cytokinin signaling to regulate the orientation of pericycle cell division during lateral root initiation</title><secondary-title>PloS One</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS One</full-title><abbr-1>PLoS ONE</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e56370</pages><volume>8</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Arabidopsis</keyword><keyword>Arabidopsis Proteins</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation, Plant</keyword><keyword>Plant Roots</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Cytokinins</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Indoleacetic Acids</keyword><keyword>Membrane Transport Proteins</keyword><keyword>Protein Transport</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0056370</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In Arabidopsis thaliana, lateral roots (LRs) initiate from anticlinal cell divisions of pericycle founder cells. The formation of LR primordia is regulated antagonistically by the phytohormones cytokinin and auxin. It has previously been shown that cytokinin has an inhibitory effect on the patterning events occurring during LR formation. However, the molecular players involved in cytokinin repression are still unknown. In a similar manner to protoxylem formation in Arabidopsis roots, in which AHP6 (ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN 6) acts as a cytokinin inhibitor, we reveal that AHP6 also functions as a cytokinin repressor during early stages of LR development. We show that AHP6 is expressed at different developmental stages during LR formation and is required for the correct orientation of cell divisions at the onset of LR development. Moreover, we demonstrate that AHP6 influences the localization of the auxin efflux carrier PIN1, which is necessary for patterning the LR primordia. In summary, we show that the inhibition of cytokinin signaling through AHP6 is required to establish the correct pattern during LR initiation.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23457561</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mähönen, Ari Pekka</author><author>Bishopp, Anthony</author><author>Higuchi, Masayuki</author><author>Nieminen, Kaisa M.</author><author>Kinoshita, Kaori</author><author>Törmäkangas, Kirsi</author><author>Ikeda, Yoshihisa</author><author>Oka, Atsuhiro</author><author>Kakimoto, Tatsuo</author><author>Helariutta, Ykä</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytokinin signaling and its inhibitor AHP6 regulate cell fate during vascular development</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title><abbr-1>Science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>94-98</pages><volume>311</volume><number>5757</number><issue>5757</issue><keywords><keyword>Arabidopsis</keyword><keyword>Arabidopsis Proteins</keyword><keyword>Genes, Plant</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Plant Roots</keyword><keyword>Plants, Genetically Modified</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Cytokinins</keyword><keyword>Plant Shoots</keyword><keyword>Cell Division</keyword><keyword>Adenosine Triphosphate</keyword><keyword>Alleles</keyword><keyword>Cell Differentiation</keyword><keyword>Cell Lineage</keyword><keyword>Cloning, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Kinetin</keyword><keyword>Meristem</keyword><keyword>Morphogenesis</keyword><keyword>Plant Growth Regulators</keyword><keyword>Suppression, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Zeatin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>Jan 6, 2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1095-9203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1118875</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The cell lineages that form the transporting tissues (xylem and phloem) and the intervening pluripotent procambial tissue originate from stem cells near the root tip.

In these systems, histidine-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) proteins mediate the signal transmission from sensory histidine kinases to response regulators, including integration of several signaling pathways or branching into different pathways. We have determined the crystal structure of a maize HPt protein, ZmHP2, at 2.2 Å resolution. ZmHP2 has six α-helices with a four-helix bundle at the C-terminus, a feature commonly found in HPt domains. In ZmHP2, almost all of the conserved residues among plant HPt proteins surround this histidine, probably forming the docking interface for the receiver domain of histidine kinase or the response regulator. Arg102 of ZmHP2 is conserved as a basic residue in plant HPt proteins. In bacteria, it is replaced by glutamine or glutamate that form a hydrogen bond to Nδ atoms of the phospho-accepting histidine. It may play a key role in the complex formation of ZmHP2 with receiver domains.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2253335/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\4ZIZ47IE\Sugawara et al. - 2005 - Crystal structure of the histidine-containing phos.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2253335/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-06-13 00:09:51</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eddy, S.

This class of bacterial sensory kinases, typified by ArcB and BarA, possesses two phospho-donor (His) sites, together with a phospho-accepting (Asp) site. These multi-phosphorylation sites were suggested to make a phosphotransfer circuit. To clarify this complex circuitry, we carried out a series of in vitro assays involving a set of ArcB mutant proteins which have an amino acid substitution at each putative phosphorylation site (His-292, Asp-576 and His-717). By these in vitro phosphorylation and/or phosphotransfer assays, the followings were assessed: (i) ArcB autophosphorylation; (ii) ArcB-mediated phosphorylation of the cognate response regulator, ArcA; (iii) ArcB-mediated phosphorylation of its truncated form (ArcBc) encompassing only the C-terminal phosphorylation site (His-717); (iv) phosphotransfer from ArcBc to ArcA; and (v) phosphotransfer from ArcBc to ArcB. On the basis of these in vitro results, a complex circuitry was revealed for the signal transducer ArcB. This evidence obtained in vitro supports the view that ArcB can serve as a powerful device for not only propagating multi-signals, but also making up signalling networks, in ways more sophisticated than previously thought.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.18050953.x/abstract</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PGCNIMQA\abstract.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-06-13 00:05:45</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stock, Ann M.</author><author>Robinson, Victoria L.</author><author>Goudreau, Paul N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Two-Component Signal Transduction</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Biochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>183-215</pages><volume>69</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>gene expression</keyword><keyword>histidine protein kinase</keyword><keyword>protein conformational change</keyword><keyword>response regulator</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.183</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Most prokaryotic signal-transduction systems and a few eukaryotic pathways use phosphotransfer schemes involving two conserved components, a histidine protein kinase and a response regulator protein. The histidine protein kinase, which is regulated by environmental stimuli, autophosphorylates at a histidine residue, creating a high-energy phosphoryl group that is subsequently transferred to an aspartate residue in the response regulator protein. Phosphorylation induces a conformational change in the regulatory domain that results in activation of an associated domain that effects the response. The basic scheme is highly adaptable, and numerous variations have provided optimization within specific signaling systems. The domains of two-component proteins are modular and can be integrated into proteins and pathways in a variety of ways, but the core structures and activities are maintained. Thus detailed analyses of a relatively small number of representative proteins provide a foundation for understanding this large family of signaling proteins.</abstract><remote-database-name>Annual Reviews</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.183</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-06-13 00:03:26</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eddy, Sean R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Probabilistic Model of Local Sequence Alignment That Simplifies Statistical Significance Estimation</title><secondary-title>PLoS Comput Biol</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS Comput Biol</full-title><abbr-1>PLoS Comput Biol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e1000069</pages><volume>4</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>May 30, 2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000069</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Author SummarySequence database searches are a fundamental tool of molecular biology, enabling researchers to identify related sequences in other organisms, which often provides invaluable clues to the function and evolutionary history of genes. The power of database searches to detect more and more remote evolutionary relationships – essentially, to look back deeper in time – has improved steadily, with the adoption of more complex and realistic models. However, database searches require not just a realistic scoring model, but also the ability to distinguish good scores from bad ones – the ability to calculate the statistical significance of scores. For many models and scoring schemes, accurate statistical significance calculations have either involved expensive computational simulations, or not been feasible at all. Here, I introduce a probabilistic model of local sequence alignment that has readily predictable score statistics for position-specific profile scoring systems, and not just for traditional optimal alignment scores, but also for more powerful log-likelihood ratio scores derived in a full probabilistic inference framework. These results remove one of the main obstacles that have impeded the use of more powerful and biologically realistic statistical inference methods in sequence homology searches.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000069</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\CQKBCTH2\Eddy - 2008 - A Probabilistic Model of Local Sequence Alignment .pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2015-05-20 16:47:15</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eddy, Sean R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Accelerated Profile HMM Searches</title><secondary-title>PLoS Comput Biol</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS Comput Biol</full-title><abbr-1>PLoS Comput Biol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e1002195</pages><volume>7</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>October 20, 2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002195</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Author Summary&#xD;Searching sequence databases is one of the most important applications in computational molecular biology. The main workhorse in the field is the BLAST suite of programs. Since the introduction of BLAST in the 1990's, important theoretical advances in homology search methodology have been made using probabilistic inference methods and hidden Markov models (HMMs). However, previous software implementations of these newer probabilistic methods were slower than BLAST by about 100-fold. This hindered their utility, because computation speed is so critical with the rapidly increasing size of modern sequence databases. Here I describe the acceleration methods I implemented in a new, freely available profile HMM software package, HMMER3.

Microbial community characterization using small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequences has revealed an extensive, previously unsuspected diversity that we are only now beginning to understand, especially now that advanced sequencing technologies are producing data sets containing hundreds of thousands of sequences from hundreds of samples. Efforts to quantify microbial diversity often use taxon-based methods that ignore the fact that not all species are equally related, which can therefore obscure important patterns in the data. For example, α diversity (diversity within communities) is often estimated as the number of species in a community (species richness), and β diversity (partitioning of diversity among communities) is often based on the number of shared species. Methods for measuring α diversity and β diversity that account for different levels of divergence between individuals have recently been more widely applied. These methods are more powerful than taxon-based methods because microbes in a community differ dramatically in sequence similarity, which also often correlates with phenotypic similarity in key features such as metabolic capabilities. Consequently, divergence-based methods are providing new insights into microbial community structure and function.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2443784/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\9EU22VNB\Lozupone and Knight - 2008 - Species Divergence and the Measurement of Microbia.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2443784/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-05-01 13:25:42</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Friedman, Jerome</author><author>Hastie, Trevor</author><author>Tibshirani, Rob</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent</title><secondary-title>Journal of Statistical Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Statistical Software</full-title><abbr-1>J Stat Softw</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1-22</pages><volume>33</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1548-7660</isbn><abstract>We develop fast algorithms for estimation of generalized linear models with convex penalties.

To distinguish the systematic changes in expression between conditions from noise, the counts are frequently modeled by the Negative Binomial distribution. However, in experiments with small sample size, the per-gene estimates of the dispersion parameter are unreliable.&#xD;METHOD: We propose a simple and effective approach for estimating the dispersions. First, we obtain the initial estimates for each gene using the method of moments. Second, the estimates are regularized, i.e. shrunk towards a common value that minimizes the average squared difference between the initial estimates and the shrinkage estimates. The approach does not require extra modeling assumptions, is easy to compute and is compatible with the exact test of differential expression.&#xD;RESULTS: We evaluated the proposed approach using 10 simulated and experimental datasets and compared its performance with that of currently popular packages edgeR, DESeq, baySeq, BBSeq and SAMseq. For these datasets, sSeq performed favorably for experiments with small sample size in sensitivity, specificity and computational time.&#xD;AVAILABILITY: http://www.stat.purdue.edu/∼ovitek/Software.html and Bioconductor.&#xD;CONTACT: ovitek@purdue.edu&#xD;SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23589650</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Segata, Nicola</author><author>Izard, Jacques</author><author>Waldron, Levi</author><author>Gevers, Dirk</author><author>Miropolsky, Larisa</author><author>Garrett, Wendy S.</author><author>Huttenhower, Curtis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metagenomic biomarker discovery and explanation</title><secondary-title>Genome Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Genome Biol.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>R60</pages><volume>12</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Bacteria</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological Markers</keyword><keyword>Colitis, Ulcerative</keyword><keyword>Data Mining</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Metagenome</keyword><keyword>Metagenomics</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Mice, Inbred BALB C</keyword><keyword>Mice, Knockout</keyword><keyword>Mucous Membrane</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Software</keyword><keyword>Viruses</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1465-6914</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/gb-2011-12-6-r60</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study describes and validates a new method for metagenomic biomarker discovery by way of class comparison, tests of biological consistency and effect size estimation.

A computer-solved model has been used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees beta-cell deficiency and insulin resistance. Comparison of a patient's fasting values with the model's predictions allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin resistance and deficient beta-cell function to the fasting hyperglycaemia (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA). The accuracy and precision of the estimate have been determined by comparison with independent measures of insulin resistance and beta-cell function using hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic clamps and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The estimate of insulin resistance obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with estimates obtained by use of the euglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.88, p less than 0.0001), the fasting insulin concentration (Rs = 0.81, p less than 0.0001), and the hyperglycaemic clamp, (Rs = 0.69, p less than 0.01). There was no correlation with any aspect of insulin-receptor binding. The estimate of deficient beta-cell function obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with that derived using the hyperglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.61, p less than 0.01) and with the estimate from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (Rs = 0.64, p less than 0.05). The low precision of the estimates from the model (coefficients of variation: 31% for insulin resistance and 32% for beta-cell deficit) limits its use, but the correlation of the model's estimates with patient data accords with the hypothesis that basal glucose and insulin interactions are largely determined by a simple feed back loop.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3899825</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schaap, Pauline</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolutionary crossroads in developmental biology: Dictyostelium discoideum</title><secondary-title>Development (Cambridge, England)</secondary-title><short-title>Evolutionary crossroads in developmental biology</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Development (Cambridge, England)</full-title><abbr-1>Development</abbr-1></periodical><pages>387-396</pages><volume>138</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Biological Evolution</keyword><keyword>Developmental Biology</keyword><keyword>Dictyostelium</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>Feb 2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1477-9129</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/dev.048934</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Dictyostelium discoideum belongs to a group of multicellular life forms that can also exist for long periods as single cells.

The importance of two-component histidine kinases in bacteria, fungi and plants has long been recognised. In mammals, the regulatory roles of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases have attracted most attention. However, the existence of histidine kinases in mammalian cells has been known for many years, although little is still understood about their biological roles by comparison with the hydroxyamino acid kinases. In addition, with the exception of NDP kinase, other mammalian histidine kinases remain to be identified and characterised. NDP kinase is a multifunctional enzyme that appears to act as a protein histidine kinase and as such, to regulate the activation of some G-proteins. Histone H4 histidine kinase activity has been shown to correlate with cellular proliferation and there is evidence that it is an oncodevelopmental marker in liver. This review mainly concentrates on describing recent research on these two types of histidine kinase. Developments in methods for the detection and assay of histidine kinases, including mass spectrometric methods for the detection of phosphohistidines in proteins and in-gel kinase assays for histone H4 histidine kinases, are described. Little is known about inhibitors of mammalian histidine kinases, although there is much interest in two-component histidine kinase inhibitors as potential antibiotics. The inhibition of a histone H4 histidine kinase by genistein is described and that of two-component histidine kinase inhibitors of structurally-related mammalian protein kinases. In addition, recent findings concerning mammalian protein histidine phosphatases are briefly described.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16188507</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Song, Hyun Kyu</author><author>Lee, Jae Young</author><author>Lee, Myong Gyong</author><author>Moon, Jinho</author><author>Min, Kyeongsik</author><author>Yang, Jin Kuk</author><author>Suh, Se Won</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Insights into eukaryotic multistep phosphorelay signal transduction revealed by the crystal structure of Ypd1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae1</title><secondary-title>Journal of Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Molecular Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Molecular Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>753-761</pages><volume>293</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</keyword><keyword>crystal structure</keyword><keyword>phosphorelay phosphotransferase</keyword><keyword>signal transduction</keyword><keyword>Ypd1p</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>November 5, 1999</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-2836</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1006/jmbi.1999.3215</electronic-resource-num><abstract>“Two-component” phosphorelay signal transduction systems constitute a potential target for antibacterial and antifungal agents, since they are found exclusively in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes (yeast, fungi, slime mold, and plants) but not in mammalian organisms. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ypd1p, a key intermediate in the osmosensing multistep phosphorelay signal transduction, catalyzes the phosphoryl group transfer between response regulators. Its 1.8 Å structure, representing the first example of a eukaryotic phosphorelay protein, contains a four-helix bundle as in the HPt domain of Escherichia coli ArcB sensor kinase. However, Ypd1p has a 44-residue insertion between the last two helices of the helix bundle. The side-chain of His64, the site of phosphorylation, protrudes into the solvent. The structural resemblance between Ypd1p and ArcB HPt domain suggests that both prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes utilize the same basic protein fold for phosphorelay signal transduction. This study sheds light on the best characterized eukaryotic phosphorelay system.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283699932151</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\RGNJSKUN\Song et al. - 1999 - Insights into eukaryotic multistep phosphorelay si.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\BK8D2URS\Song et al. - 1999 - Insights into eukaryotic multistep phosphorelay si.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-04-13 02:11:39</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sugawara, Hajime</author><author>Kawano, Yoshiaki</author><author>Hatakeyama, Tomomitsu</author><author>Yamaya, Tomoyuki</author><author>Kamiya, Nobuo</author><author>Sakakibara, Hitoshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Crystal structure of the histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein ZmHP2 from maize</title><secondary-title>Protein Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Protein Science</full-title></periodical><pages>202-208</pages><volume>14</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-01-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>09618368</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1110/ps.041076905</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>CrossRef</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1110/ps.041076905</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-04-13 02:10:26</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mourey, Lionel</author><author>Re, Sandra Da</author><author>Pédelacq, Jean-Denis</author><author>Tolstykh, Tatiana</author><author>Faurie, Cécile</author><author>Guillet, Valérie</author><author>Stock, Jeffry B.</author><author>Samama, Jean-Pierre</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Crystal Structure of the CheA Histidine Phosphotransfer Domain that Mediates Response Regulator Phosphorylation in Bacterial Chemotaxis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>J.

The structure is composed of an up-down up-down four-helix bundle that is typical of histidine phosphotransfer or HPt domains such as Escherichia coli ArcBC andSaccharomyces cerevisiae Ypd1. Loop regions and additional structural features distinguish all three proteins. The CheA domain has an additional C-terminal helix that lies over the surface formed by the C and D helices. The phosphoaccepting His-48 is located at a solvent-exposed position in the middle of the B helix where it is surrounded by several residues that are characteristic of other HPt domains. Mutagenesis studies indicate that conserved glutamate and lysine residues that are part of a hydrogen-bond network with His-48 are essential for the ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction but not for the phosphotransfer reaction with CheY. These results suggest that the CheA-P1 domain may serve as a good model for understanding the general function of HPt domains in complex two-component phosphorelay systems.</abstract><remote-database-name>intl.jbc.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jbc.org/content/276/33/31074</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\2UQEGRCV\Mourey et al. - 2001 - Crystal Structure of the CheA Histidine Phosphotra.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11387324</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8JGUJVXR\Mourey et al. - 2001 - Crystal Structure of the CheA Histidine Phosphotra.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-04-13 02:09:22</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Geman, Stuart</author><author>Geman, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stochastic Relaxation, Gibbs Distributions, and the Bayesian Restoration of Images</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</full-title></periodical><pages>721-741</pages><volume>PAMI-6</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Additive noise</keyword><keyword>Annealing</keyword><keyword>Bayesian methods</keyword><keyword>Deformable models</keyword><keyword>Degradation</keyword><keyword>Energy states</keyword><keyword>Gibbs distribution</keyword><keyword>image restoration</keyword><keyword>Image restoration</keyword><keyword>line process</keyword><keyword>MAP estimate</keyword><keyword>Markov random field</keyword><keyword>Markov random fields</keyword><keyword>relaxation</keyword><keyword>scene modeling</keyword><keyword>spatial degradation</keyword><keyword>Stochastic processes</keyword><keyword>Temperature distribution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1984</year><pub-dates><date>November 1984</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0162-8828</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TPAMI.1984.4767596</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (“annealing”), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel “relaxation” algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.</abstract><remote-database-name>IEEE Xplore</remote-database-name><urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\EFI3I4KS\Geman and Geman - 1984 - Stochastic Relaxation, Gibbs Distributions, and th.html</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thompson, William</author><author>Rouchka, Eric C.</author><author>Lawrence, Charles E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gibbs Recursive Sampler: finding transcription factor binding sites</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acids Research</secondary-title><short-title>Gibbs Recursive Sampler</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic Acids Research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucleic Acids Res.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>3580-3585</pages><volume>31</volume><number>13</number><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Software</keyword><keyword>Binding Sites</keyword><keyword>Genetic Variation</keyword><keyword>Internet</keyword><keyword>Markov Chains</keyword><keyword>Monte Carlo Method</keyword><keyword>Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword><keyword>Statistics, Nonparametric</keyword><keyword>Transcription Initiation Site</keyword><keyword>User-Computer Interface</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>Jul 1, 2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1362-4962</isbn><abstract>The Gibbs Motif Sampler is a software package for locating common elements in collections of biopolymer sequences.

We present a method that can be applied to the problem of identifying the recognition pattern for a DNA-binding protein given only a collection of sequenced DNA fragments, each known to contain somewhere within it a binding site for that protein. Information about the position or orientation of the binding sites within those fragments is not needed. The method compares the "information content" of a large number of possible binding site alignments to arrive at a matrix representation of the binding site pattern. The specificity of the protein is represented as a matrix, rather than a consensus sequence, allowing patterns that are typical of regulatory protein-binding sites to be identified. The reliability of the method improves as the number of sequences increases, but the time required increases only linearly with the number of sequences. An example, using known cAMP receptor protein-binding sites, illustrates the method.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2919167</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Neuwald, A.

A new Gibbs sampling algorithm is described that detects motif-encoding regions in sequences and optimally partitions them into distinct motif models; this is illustrated using a set of immunoglobulin fold proteins. When applied to sequences sharing a single motif, the sampler can be used to classify motif regions into related submodels, as is illustrated using helix-turn-helix DNA-binding proteins. Other statistically based procedures are described for searching a database for sequences matching motifs found by the sampler. When applied to a set of 32 very distantly related bacterial integral outer membrane proteins, the sampler revealed that they share a subtle, repetitive motif. Although BLAST (Altschul SF et al., 1990, J Mol Biol 215:403-410) fails to detect significant pairwise similarity between any of the sequences, the repeats present in these outer membrane proteins, taken as a whole, are highly significant (based on a generally applicable statistical test for motifs described here). Analysis of bacterial porins with known trimeric beta-barrel structure and related proteins reveals a similar repetitive motif corresponding to alternating membrane-spanning beta-strands. These beta-strands occur on the membrane interface (as opposed to the trimeric interface) of the beta-barrel. The broad conservation and structural location of these repeats suggests that they play important functional roles.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2143180/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\INVQM662\Neuwald et al. - 1995 - Gibbs motif sampling detection of bacterial outer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2143180/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-04-13 01:47:35</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baldi, P</author><author>Chauvin, Y</author><author>Hunkapiller, T</author><author>McClure, M A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hidden Markov models of biological primary sequence information.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1059-1063</pages><volume>91</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994-2-1</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424</isbn><abstract>Hidden Markov model (HMM) techniques are used to model families of biological sequences.

In all cases, the models derived capture the important statistical characteristics of the family and can be used for a number of tasks, including multiple alignments, motif detection, and classification.

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.</abstract><remote-database-name>JSTOR</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jstor.org/stable/2346178</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\XGCVN2IN\Tibshirani - 1996 - Regression Shrinkage and Selection via the Lasso.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2015-04-09 19:26:50</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Segal, Mark R.</author><author>Dahlquist, Kam D.</author><author>Conklin, Bruce R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regression Approaches for Microarray Data Analysis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Computational Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Computational Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Computational Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>961-980</pages><volume>10</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>December 1, 2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1066-5277</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1089/106652703322756177</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A variety of new procedures have been devised to handle the two-sample comparison (e.g., tumor versus normal tissue) of gene expression values as measured with microarrays. Such new methods are required          in part because of some defining characteristics of microarray-based studies: (i) the very large number of genes contributing expression measures which far exceeds the number of samples (observations) available          and (ii) the fact that by virtue of pathway/network relationships, the gene expression measures tend to be highly correlated. These concerns are exacerbated in the regression setting, where the objective          is to relate gene expression, simultaneously for multiple genes, to some external outcome or phenotype. Correspondingly, several methods have been recently proposed for addressing these issues. We briefly          critique some of these methods prior to a detailed evaluation of gene harvesting. This reveals that gene harvesting, without additional constraints, can yield artifactual solutions. Results obtained          employing such constraints motivate the use of regularized regression procedures such as the lasso, least angle regression, and support vector machines. Model selection and solution multiplicity issues          are also discussed. The methods are evaluated using a microarray-based study of cardiomyopathy in transgenic mice.</abstract><remote-database-name>online.liebertpub.com (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/106652703322756177</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-04-09 19:26:17</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jegatheesan, Prasanthi</author><author>Beutheu, Stéphanie</author><author>Ventura, Gabrielle</author><author>Sarfati, Gilles</author><author>Nubret, Esther</author><author>Kapel, Nathalie</author><author>Waligora-Dupriet, Anne-Judith</author><author>Bergheim, Ina</author><author>Cynober, Luc</author><author>De-Bandt, Jean-Pascal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of specific amino acids on hepatic lipid metabolism in fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</title><secondary-title>Clinical Nutrition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Nutrition</full-title><abbr-1>Clinical Nutrition</abbr-1></periodical><keywords><keyword>Arginine</keyword><keyword>Citrulline</keyword><keyword>Glutamine</keyword><keyword>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</keyword></keywords><dates/><isbn>0261-5614</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.clnu.2015.01.021</electronic-resource-num><abstract>SummaryBackground &amp;amp; aim&#xD;Fructose diets have been shown to induce insulin resistance and to alter liver metabolism and gut barrier function, ultimately leading to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Citrulline, Glutamine and Arginine may improve insulin sensitivity and have beneficial effects on gut trophicity. Our aim was to evaluate their effects on liver and gut functions in a rat model of fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.&#xD;Methods&#xD;Male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 58) received a 4-week fructose (60%) diet or standard chow with or without Citrulline (0.15 g/d) or an isomolar amount of Arginine or Glutamine. All diets were made isonitrogenous by addition of non-essential amino acids. At week 4, nutritional and metabolic status (plasma glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides and amino acids, net intestinal absorption) was determined; steatosis (hepatic triglycerides content, histological examination) and hepatic function (plasma aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) were assessed; and gut barrier integrity (myeloperoxidase activity, portal endotoxemia, tight junction protein expression and localization) and intestinal and hepatic inflammation were evaluated. We also assessed diets effects on caecal microbiota.&#xD;Results&#xD;In these experimental isonitrogenous fructose diet conditions, fructose led to steatosis with dyslipidemia but without altering glucose homeostasis, liver function or gut permeability. Fructose significantly decreased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and tended to increase endotoxemia. Arginine and Glutamine supplements were ineffective but Citrulline supplementation prevented hypertriglyceridemia and attenuated liver fat accumulation.&#xD;Conclusion&#xD;While nitrogen supply alone can attenuate fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Citrulline appears to act directly on hepatic lipid metabolism by partially preventing hypertriglyceridemia and steatosis.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561415000436</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\JGUK8P47\Jegatheesan et al. - Effect of specific amino acids on hepatic lipid me.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\2PK6G8DT\Jegatheesan et al. - Effect of specific amino acids on hepatic lipid me.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-04-02 13:17:58</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Benoit, Bérengère</author><author>Laugerette, Fabienne</author><author>Plaisancié, Pascale</author><author>Géloën, Alain</author><author>Bodennec, Jacques</author><author>Estienne, Monique</author><author>Pineau, Gaëlle</author><author>Bernalier-Donadille, Annick</author><author>Vidal, Hubert</author><author>Michalski, Marie-Caroline</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Increasing fat content from 20 to 45 wt% in a complex diet induces lower endotoxemia in parallel with an increased number of intestinal goblet cells in mice</title><secondary-title>Nutrition Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nutrition Research</full-title><abbr-1>Nutrition Research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>346-356</pages><volume>35</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Adipokine</keyword><keyword>Endotoxin</keyword><keyword>Intestine</keyword><keyword>microbiota</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>April 2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0271-5317</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.nutres.2015.01.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The impacts of high-fat diets (HFDs) on the onset of metabolic endotoxemia and low-grade inflammation are well established in rodent models. However, the dose-effect of dietary lipid intakes on these parameters is not known. We hypothesized that increasing dietary lipid amounts could be linked to parallel increases of endotoxemia, low-grade inflammation, and metabolic and intestinal alterations. Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a low-fat diet (LFD, 2.6 wt% of lipids), a moderate HFD (mHFD, 22 wt% of lipids), or a very HFD (vHFD, 45 wt% of lipids) formulated mainly using chow ingredients and milk fat. After 12 weeks, white adipose tissues, liver, intestine, distal colon contents, and plasma were collected. Only vHFD mice significantly increased body weight and fat mass vs LFD mice. This was associated with increases of plasma concentrations of triglycerides, leptin and adiponectin, and liver lipids. No such differences were observed between LFD and mHFD mice. However, mHFD developed metabolic endotoxemia and inflammation, unlike vHFD mice. In turn, vHFD mice showed more goblet cells in all intestine segments vs both other groups and a decrease of Bacteroides-Prevotella in their microbiota vs LFD mice. Finally, mHFD mice colon exhibited a decrease in lactobacilli and in the levels of occludin phosphorylation. Altogether, using complex HFD, no associations were observed between dietary lipid amounts and the magnitude of endotoxemia, inflammation, and physiological alterations developed. These results reveal the impact of the diet composition on intestinal goblet cells and mucus coat, bringing new insights about further consequences on HFD-induced metabolic disorders.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531715000068</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\DNENTI7A\Benoit et al. - 2015 - Increasing fat content from 20 to 45 wt% in a comp.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TT9SWZRJ\Benoit et al. - 2015 - Increasing fat content from 20 to 45 wt% in a comp.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-03-27 20:33:33</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shin, Na-Ri</author><author>Lee, June-Chul</author><author>Lee, Hae-Youn</author><author>Kim, Min-Soo</author><author>Whon, Tae Woong</author><author>Lee, Myung-Shik</author><author>Bae, Jin-Woo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An increase in the Akkermansia spp. population induced by metformin treatment improves glucose homeostasis in diet-induced obese mice</title><secondary-title>Gut</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gut</full-title><abbr-1>Gut</abbr-1></periodical><pages>727-735</pages><volume>63</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Intestinal Bacteria</keyword><keyword>Mucins</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Pharmacotherapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>05/01/2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>, 1468-3288</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303839</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background Recent evidence indicates that the composition of the gut microbiota contributes to the development of metabolic disorders by affecting the physiology and metabolism of the host.

However, whether IL-22 participates into immune homeostasis by way of modulating gut microbiota remains to be elucidated. In this study, we find through 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analysis that healthy IL-22 deficient mice had altered colonic microbiota, notably with decreased abundance of some genera including Lactobacillus and increased levels of others. Mice harboring this altered microbiota exhibited more severe disease during experimentally-induced colitis. Interestingly, this altered gut microbiota can be transmitted to co-housed wild-type animals along with the increased susceptibility to this colitis, indicating an important role of IL-22 in shaping the homeostatic balance between immunity and colonic microbiota for host health.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3646987/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\IMEZQ2IK\Zenewicz et al. - 2013 - Interleukin-22 deficiency alters colonic microbiot.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3646987/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-03-24 19:42:44</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tilg, Herbert</author><author>Moschen, Alexander R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolution of inflammation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: The multiple parallel hits hypothesis</title><secondary-title>Hepatology</secondary-title><short-title>Evolution of inflammation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hepatology</full-title><abbr-1>Hepatology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1836-1846</pages><volume>52</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>November 1, 2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1527-3350</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hep.24001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Whereas in most cases a fatty liver remains free of inflammation, 10%-20% of patients who have fatty liver develop inflammation and fibrosis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]). Inflammation may precede steatosis in certain instances. Therefore, NASH could reflect a disease where inflammation is followed by steatosis. In contrast, NASH subsequent to simple steatosis may be the consequence of a failure of antilipotoxic protection. In both situations, many parallel hits derived from the gut and/or the adipose tissue may promote liver inflammation. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and related signaling networks, (adipo)cytokines, and innate immunity are emerging as central pathways that regulate key features of NASH.

The ‘hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome’ is called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and comprises a wide spectrum of stages of liver disease ranging from simple steatosis to liver cirrhosis. NAFLD of different stages is found in ∼30% of adults and ∼20% in the US population. Not just a general overnutrition but also an elevated intake of certain macronutrients such as fat and carbohydrates and herein particularly fructose has been claimed to be risk factors for the development for NAFLD; however, the etiology of this disease is still unknown.

To further investigate the role of gut-derived endotoxin in the onset of fructose-induced NAFLD, Toll-like receptor (TLR-) 4-mutant (C3H/HeJ) mice and wildtype (C3H/HouJ) mice were either fed plain water or water enriched with 30% fructose for 8 weeks. Hepatic steatosis, plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and markers of insulin resistance as well as portal endotoxin levels were determined. Hepatic levels of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and 7, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) as well as markers of lipid peroxidation were assessed. Chronic intake of 30% fructose solution caused a significant increase in hepatic steatosis and plasma ALT levels in wildtype animals in comparison to water controls. In fructose-fed TLR-4 mutant mice, hepatic triglyceride accumulation was significantly reduced by approximately 40% in comparison to fructose-fed wildtype mice and plasma ALT levels were at the level of water-fed controls. No difference in portal endotoxin concentration between fructose-fed wildtype and TLR-4-mutant animals was detected. In contrast, hepatic lipid peroxidation, MyD88, and TNFalpha levels were significantly decreased in fructose-fed TLR-4-mutant mice in comparison to fructose-fed wildtype mice, whereas IRF3 and IRF7 expression remained unchanged. Markers of insulin resistance (e.g., plasma TNFalpha, retinol binding protein 4, and hepatic phospho-AKT) were only altered in fructose-fed wildtype animals.&#xD;CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data further support the hypothesis that in mice the onset of fructose-induced NAFLD is associated with intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased intestinal permeability, subsequently leading to an endotoxin-dependent activation of hepatic Kupffer cells.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19637282</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paolella, Giulia</author><author>Mandato, Claudia</author><author>Pierri, Luca</author><author>Poeta, Marco</author><author>Di Stasi, Martina</author><author>Vajro, Pietro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gut-liver axis and probiotics: Their role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</title><secondary-title>World Journal of Gastroenterology : WJG</secondary-title><short-title>Gut-liver axis and probiotics</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>World Journal of Gastroenterology : WJG</full-title><abbr-1>World J Gastroenterol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>15518-15531</pages><volume>20</volume><number>42</number><issue>42</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-11-14</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1007-9327</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3748/wjg.v20.i42.15518</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The incidence of obesity and its related conditions, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), has dramatically increased in all age groups worldwide. Given the health consequences of these conditions, and the subsequent economic burden on healthcare systems, their prevention and treatment have become major priorities. Because standard dietary and lifestyle changes and pathogenically-oriented therapies (e.g., antioxidants, oral hypoglycemic agents, and lipid-lowering agents) often fail due to poor compliance and/or lack of efficacy, novel approaches directed toward other pathomechanisms are needed. Here we present several lines of evidence indicating that, by increasing energy extraction in some dysbiosis conditions or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, specific gut microbiota and/or a “low bacterial richness” may play a role in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and fatty liver. Under conditions involving a damaged intestinal barrier (“leaky gut”), the gut-liver axis may enhance the natural interactions between intestinal bacteria/bacterial products and hepatic receptors (e.g., toll-like receptors), thus promoting the following cascade of events: oxidative stress, insulin-resistance, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis. We also discuss the possible modulation of gut microbiota by probiotics, as attempted in NAFLD animal model studies and in several pilot pediatric and adult human studies. Globally, this approach appears to be a promising and innovative add-on therapeutic tool for NAFLD in the context of multi-target therapy.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4229517/</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4229517/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-03-23 21:22:02</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shin, Na-Ri</author><author>Lee, June-Chul</author><author>Lee, Hae-Youn</author><author>Kim, Min-Soo</author><author>Whon, Tae Woong</author><author>Lee, Myung-Shik</author><author>Bae, Jin-Woo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An increase in the Akkermansia spp. population induced by metformin treatment improves glucose homeostasis in diet-induced obese mice</title><secondary-title>Gut</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gut</full-title><abbr-1>Gut</abbr-1></periodical><pages>727-735</pages><volume>63</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Intestinal Bacteria</keyword><keyword>Mucins</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Pharmacotherapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>05/01/2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>, 1468-3288</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303839</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background Recent evidence indicates that the composition of the gut microbiota contributes to the development of metabolic disorders by affecting the physiology and metabolism of the host.

This suggests that pharmacological manipulation of the gut microbiota in favour of Akkermansia may be a potential treatment for T2D.</abstract><remote-database-name>gut.bmj.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://gut.bmj.com/content/63/5/727</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TXFVTBJE\Shin et al. - 2014 - An increase in the Akkermansia spp. population ind.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23804561</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\RPQNGHB3\Shin et al. - 2014 - An increase in the Akkermansia spp. population ind.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-03-18 14:42:35</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spruss, Astrid</author><author>Kanuri, Giridhar</author><author>Stahl, Carolin</author><author>Bischoff, Stephan C.</author><author>Bergheim, Ina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metformin protects against the development of fructose-induced steatosis in mice: role of the intestinal barrier function</title><secondary-title>Laboratory Investigation</secondary-title><short-title>Metformin protects against the development of fructose-induced steatosis in mice</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Laboratory Investigation</full-title><abbr-1>Lab Invest</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1020-1032</pages><volume>92</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>NAFLD</keyword><keyword>endotoxin</keyword><keyword>MMPs</keyword><keyword>sugar</keyword><keyword>tight junction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>July 2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0023-6837</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/labinvest.2012.75</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To test the hypothesis that metformin protects against fructose-induced steatosis, and if so, to elucidate underlying mechanisms, C57BL/6J mice were either fed 30% fructose solution or plain water for 8 weeks. Some of the animals were concomitantly treated with metformin (300 mg/kg body weight/day) in the drinking solution. While chronic consumption of 30% fructose solution caused a significant increase in hepatic triglyceride accumulation and plasma alanine-aminotransferase levels, this effect of fructose was markedly attenuated in fructose-fed mice concomitantly treatment with metformin. The protective effects of the metformin treatment on the onset of fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were associated with a protection against the loss of the tight junction proteins occludin and zonula occludens 1 in the duodenum of fructose-fed mice and the increased translocation of bacterial endotoxin found in mice only fed with fructose. In line with these findings, in metformin-treated fructose-fed animals, hepatic expression of genes of the toll-like receptor-4-dependent signalling cascade as well as the plasminogen-activator inhibitor/cMet-regulated lipid export were almost at the level of controls. Taken together, these data suggest that metformin not only protects the liver from the onset of fructose-induced NAFLD through mechanisms involving its direct effects on hepatic insulin signalling but rather through altering intestinal permeability and subsequently the endotoxin-dependent activation of hepatic Kupffer cells.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/labinvest/journal/v92/n7/full/labinvest201275a.html</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\D7AIK859\Spruss et al. - 2012 - Metformin protects against the development of fruc.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SQW9JM9D\Spruss et al. - 2012 - Metformin protects against the development of fruc.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-03-18 14:41:54</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Derrien, Muriel</author><author>Vaughan, Elaine E.</author><author>Plugge, Caroline M.</author><author>Vos, Willem M. de</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Akkermansia muciniphila gen. nov., sp. nov., a human intestinal mucin-degrading bacterium</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Int J Syst Evol Microbiol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1469-1476</pages><volume>54</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>DGGE, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis</keyword><keyword>GI, gastrointestinal</keyword><keyword>MPN, most probable number</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>09/01/2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1466-5026, 1466-5034</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1099/ijs.0.02873-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The diversity of mucin-degrading bacteria in the human intestine was investigated by combining culture and 16S rRNA-dependent approaches. A dominant bacterium, strain MucT, was isolated by dilution to extinction of faeces in anaerobic medium containing gastric mucin as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. A pure culture was obtained using the anaerobic soft agar technique. Strain MucT was a Gram-negative, strictly anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, oval-shaped bacterium that could grow singly and in pairs. When grown on mucin medium, cells produced a capsule and were found to aggregate. Strain MucT could grow on a limited number of sugars, including N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine and glucose, but only when a protein source was provided and with a lower growth rate and final density than on mucin. The G+C content of DNA from strain MucT was 47·6 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolate was part of the division Verrucomicrobia. The closest described relative of strain MucT was Verrucomicrobium spinosum (92 % sequence similarity). Remarkably, the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain MucT showed 99 % similarity to three uncultured colonic bacteria. According to the data obtained in this work, strain MucT represents a novel bacterium belonging to a new genus in subdivision 1 of the Verrucomicrobia; the name Akkermansia muciniphila gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is MucT (=ATCC BAA-835T=CIP 107961T).</abstract><remote-database-name>ijs.sgmjournals.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/54/5/1469</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\CER5B96S\Derrien et al. - 2004 - Akkermansia muciniphila gen. nov., sp. nov., a hum.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15388697</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\RIT4ABIP\Derrien et al. - 2004 - Akkermansia muciniphila gen. nov., sp. nov., a hum.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-03-18 14:39:48</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Basciano, Heather</author><author>Federico, Lisa</author><author>Adeli, Khosrow</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fructose, insulin resistance, and metabolic dyslipidemia</title><secondary-title>Nutrition &amp; Metabolism</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nutrition &amp; Metabolism</full-title></periodical><pages>5</pages><volume>2</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-02-21</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1743-7075</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1743-7075-2-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>PMID: 15723702</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nutritionandmetabolism.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/2/1/5/abstract</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\RQZ92EDJ\Basciano et al. - 2005 - Fructose, insulin resistance, and metabolic dyslip.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\N6BWPEKQ\Basciano et al. - 2005 - Fructose, insulin resistance, and metabolic dyslip.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-03-18 14:36:53</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jakobsson, H.

Microbial composition and the mechanisms of interaction with the host that affect gut barrier function during obesity and type 2 diabetes have not been elucidated. We recently isolated Akkermansia muciniphila, which is a mucin-degrading bacterium that resides in the mucus layer. The presence of this bacterium inversely correlates with body weight in rodents and humans. However, the precise physiological roles played by this bacterium during obesity and metabolic disorders are unknown. This study demonstrated that the abundance of A. muciniphila decreased in obese and type 2 diabetic mice. We also observed that prebiotic feeding normalized A. muciniphila abundance, which correlated with an improved metabolic profile. In addition, we demonstrated that A. muciniphila treatment reversed high-fat diet-induced metabolic disorders, including fat-mass gain, metabolic endotoxemia, adipose tissue inflammation, and insulin resistance. A. muciniphila administration increased the intestinal levels of endocannabinoids that control inflammation, the gut barrier, and gut peptide secretion. Finally, we demonstrated that all these effects required viable A. muciniphila because treatment with heat-killed cells did not improve the metabolic profile or the mucus layer thickness. In summary, this study provides substantial insight into the intricate mechanisms of bacterial (i.e., A. muciniphila) regulation of the cross-talk between the host and gut microbiota. These results also provide a rationale for the development of a treatment that uses this human mucus colonizer for the prevention or treatment of obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/110/22/9066</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\W8AZS8CS\Everard et al. - 2013 - Cross-talk between Akkermansia muciniphila and int.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23671105</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\M9CV3M8G\Everard et al. - 2013 - Cross-talk between Akkermansia muciniphila and int.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-03-18 14:28:38</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, Mu-En</author><author>Herr, Deron R.</author><author>Chun, Jerold</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors: signaling properties and disease relevance</title><secondary-title>Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators</secondary-title><short-title>Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators</full-title><abbr-1>Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>130-138</pages><volume>91</volume><number>3-4</number><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Disease</keyword><keyword>Lysophospholipids</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Lysophosphatidic Acid</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>Apr 2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1098-8823</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2009.02.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a water-soluble phospholipid, has gained significant attention in recent years since the discovery that it acts as a potent signaling molecule with wide-ranging effects on many different target tissues.

The complexity of the expression pattern and signaling properties of LPA receptors results in multiple influences on developmental, physiological, and pathological processes. This review provides a summary of LPA receptor signaling and current views on the potential involvement of this pathway in human diseases that include cardiovascular, cancer, neuropathic pain, neuropsychiatric disorders, reproductive disorders, and fibrosis. The involvement of LPA signaling in these processes implicates multiple, potential drug targets including LPA receptor subtypes and LPA metabolizing enzymes.

The biological roles of LPA are diverse and include developmental, physiological, and pathophysiological effects. This diversity is mediated by broad and overlapping expression patterns and multiple downstream signaling pathways activated by cognate LPA receptors. Studies using cloned receptors and genetic knockout mice have been instrumental in uncovering the significance of this signaling system, notably involving basic cellular processes as well as multiple organ systems such as the nervous system.

By employing the well-known His→Asp phosphorelay systems in both the fission yeast and Escherichia coli, evidence is presented showing that the AHK4 His-kinase has an ability to serve as a cytokinin-responsive environmental sensor. Taking advantage of this AHK4-dependent His→Asp phosphorelay system in E. coli, a phosphorelay interaction between the Arabidopsis His-kinase and histidine-containing phosphotransmitters (AHPs) was also demonstrated for the first time.</abstract><remote-database-name>pcp.oxfordjournals.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/2/107</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SNGDHJ3E\Suzuki et al. - 2001 - The Arabidopsis Sensor His-kinase, AHK4, Can Respo.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11230563</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\MV2E9X3N\Suzuki et al. - 2001 - The Arabidopsis Sensor His-kinase, AHK4, Can Respo.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-06-18 16:21:29</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miyata, Shin-ichi</author><author>Urao, Takeshi</author><author>Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, Kazuko</author><author>Shinozaki, Kazuo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization of genes for two-component phosphorelay mediators with a single HPt domain in Arabidopsis thaliana</title><secondary-title>FEBS Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FEBS Letters</full-title><abbr-1>FEBS Letters</abbr-1></periodical><pages>11-14</pages><volume>437</volume><number>1–2</number><issue>1–2</issue><keywords><keyword>Arabidopsis thaliana</keyword><keyword>HPt domain, tissue-specific expression</keyword><keyword>Two-component system</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>October 16, 1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0014-5793</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0014-5793(98)01188-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Three cDNAs that encode two-component phosphorelay-mediator-like proteins were cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana. Putative proteins (ATHP1–3) contain an HPt (Histidine-containing Phospho transfer)-like domain with a conserved histidine and some invariant residues that are involved in phosphorelay. Growth retardation of YPD1-disrupted yeast cells was reversed with ATHPs, which indicates that ATHPs function as phosphorelay mediators in yeast cells. The ATHP genes are expressed more in roots than in other tissues, similar to the expression of genes for a sensor histidine kinase, ATHK1, and response regulators ATRR1–4. These results suggest that ATHPs function as two-component phosphorelay mediators between sensor histidine kinase and response regulators in Arabidopsis.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579398011880</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\K3G9TRSI\Miyata et al. - 1998 - Characterization of genes for two-component phosph.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\E7Q8GCGP\Miyata et al. - 1998 - Characterization of genes for two-component phosph.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-06-18 16:14:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Suzuki, Tomomi</author><author>Imamura, Aya</author><author>Ueguchi, Chiharu</author><author>Mizuno, Takeshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Histidine-Containing Phosphotransfer (HPt) Signal Transducers Implicated in His-to-Asp Phosphorelay in Arabidopsis</title><secondary-title>Plant and Cell Physiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant and Cell Physiology</full-title><abbr-1>Plant Cell Physiol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1258-1268</pages><volume>39</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Arabidopsis thaliana</keyword><keyword>His-Asp phosphorelay</keyword><keyword>Histidine containing phosphotransfer domain</keyword><keyword>Signal transduction.</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>12/01/1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0032-0781, 1471-9053</isbn><abstract>His to Asp phosphorelay signal transduction mechanisms involve three types of widespread signaling components: a sensor His-kinase, a response regulator, and a histidine-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) domain. In Arabidopsis, several sensor His-kinases have recently been discovered (e.g., ETR1 and CKI1) through extensive genetic studies. Furthermore, a recent search for response regulators in this higher plant revealed that it possesses a group of response regulators (ARR-series), each of which exhibits the phospho-accepting receiver function. However, no signal transducer containing the HPt domain has been reported. Here we identify three distinct Arabidopsis genes (AHP1 to AHP3), each encoding a signal transducer containing a HPt domain. Both in vivo and in vitro evidence that each AHP can function as a phospho-transmitting HPt domain with an active histidine site was obtained by employing both the Escherichia coli and yeast His-Asp phosphorelay systems. It was demonstrated that AHP1 exhibits in vivo ability to complement a mutational lesion of the yeast YPD1 gene, encoding a typical HPt domain involved in an osmosensing signal transduction. It was also demonstrated that AHPs can interact in vitro with ARRs through the His-Asp phosphotransfer reaction. It was thus suggested that the uncovered sensors-AHPs-ARRs lineups may play important roles in propagating environmental stimuli through the multistep His-Asp phosphorelay in Arabidopsis.</abstract><remote-database-name>pcp.oxfordjournals.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/12/1258</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3D9ZHFWQ\Suzuki et al. - 1998 - Histidine-Containing Phosphotransfer (HPt) Signal .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10050311</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\D63URAU3\Suzuki et al. - 1998 - Histidine-Containing Phosphotransfer (HPt) Signal .html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-06-18 16:10:17</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gabaldón, Toni</author><author>Dessimoz, Christophe</author><author>Huxley-Jones, Julie</author><author>Vilella, Albert J.</author><author>Sonnhammer, Erik LL</author><author>Lewis, Suzanna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Joining forces in the quest for orthologs</title><secondary-title>Genome Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>403</pages><volume>10</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-09-29</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1465-6906</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/gb-2009-10-9-403</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Better orthology-prediction resources would be beneficial for the whole biological community.

The current release introduces several novel features and a streamlined user interface resulting in a faster and more comfortable workflow. The underlying protein databases were greatly expanded, resulting in a 2-fold increase in number of annotated domains and features. The database of completely sequenced genomes now includes 1133 species, compared to 630 in the previous release. Domain architecture analysis results can now be exported and visualized through the iTOL phylogenetic tree viewer. ‘metaSMART’ was introduced as a novel subresource dedicated to the exploration and analysis of domain architectures in various metagenomics data sets.

Overexpression of the STE4 protein led to cell cycle arrest of haploid cells. This arrest was like the arrest mediated by mating pheromones in that it led to similar morphological changes in the arrested cells. The arrest occurred in haploid cells of either mating type but not in MATa/MAT alpha diploids, and it was suppressed by defects in genes such as STE12 that are needed for pheromone response. Overexpression of the STE4 gene product also suppressed the sterility of cells defective in the mating pheromone receptors encoded by the STE2 and STE3 genes. Cell cycle arrest mediated by STE4 overexpression was prevented in cells that either were overexpressing the SCG1 gene product (the alpha subunit of the G protein) or lacked the STE18 gene product (the gamma subunit of the G protein). This finding suggests that in yeast cells, the beta subunit is the limiting component of the active beta gamma element and that a proper balance in the levels of the G-protein subunits is critical to a normal mating pheromone response.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC360729/</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC360729/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-05-04 02:05:14</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chang, F</author><author>Herskowitz, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of a gene necessary for cell cycle arrest by a negative growth factor of yeast: FAR1 is an inhibitor of a G1 cyclin, CLN2</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title><short-title>Identification of a gene necessary for cell cycle arrest by a negative growth factor of yeast</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title><abbr-1>Cell</abbr-1></periodical><pages>999-1011</pages><volume>63</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Cloning, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Cell cycle</keyword><keyword>Chromosome Deletion</keyword><keyword>Cyclins</keyword><keyword>Genes, Fungal</keyword><keyword>Genes, Suppressor</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Interphase</keyword><keyword>Open Reading Frames</keyword><keyword>Peptides</keyword><keyword>Pheromones</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>Nov 30, 1990</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0092-8674</isbn><abstract>alpha factor is a negative growth factor and differentiation factor that induces G1 arrest and increases transcription of mating genes in S. cerevisiae a cells. We have identified a gene, FAR1 (for "factor arrest"), which is necessary for cell cycle arrest but not for other responses to alpha factor: far1- mutants are insensitive to arrest despite having an intact signal transduction pathway. FAR1 is a nonessential gene whose expression is induced 4- to 5-fold in a cells by alpha factor. The sequence of FAR1 indicates no significant similarities to known proteins. A null mutation in the CLN2 gene, which codes for a G1 cyclin, reverses the effect of a far1 null mutation: far1- cln2- strains arrest in response to alpha factor. We thus propose that FAR1 contributes to cell cycle arrest by inhibiting CLN2. The behavior of far1- cln2- strains indicates that products other than FAR1 are responsible for inhibiting the other G1 cyclins, CLN1 and CLN3.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2147873</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dietzel, C</author><author>Kurjan, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The yeast SCG1 gene: a G alpha-like protein implicated in the a- and alpha-factor response pathway</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title><short-title>The yeast SCG1 gene</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title><abbr-1>Cell</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1001-1010</pages><volume>50</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</keyword><keyword>Phenotype</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Biological Evolution</keyword><keyword>Models, Biological</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Genes, Fungal</keyword><keyword>Peptides</keyword><keyword>Fungal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Genes</keyword><keyword>Genetic Complementation Test</keyword><keyword>GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>Rats</keyword><keyword>Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1987</year><pub-dates><date>Sep 25, 1987</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0092-8674</isbn><abstract>We have identified the SCG1 gene by its ability to suppress the pheromone-supersensitive sst2-1 mutation. The nucleotide sequence of SCG1 suggests that it encodes a 54 kd protein homologous to the alpha subunit of the vertebrate G proteins transducin, Gs, Gi, and Go. SCG1 expression and function are haploid-specific; haploid scg1 cells grow into very small colonies consisting of large, abnormally shaped cells, whereas a/alpha scg1/scg1 diploids show wild-type morphology, growth, and sporulation. We postulate that the SCG1 product is involved in the pheromone response pathway, and propose two models for the function of the SCG1 product. Expression of the rat alpha s gene in yeast partially complements both the sst2 and scg1 defects, indicating a high level of conservation of sequence and function between SCG1 and mammalian G alpha subunits.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3113738</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Elion, E A</author><author>Brill, J A</author><author>Fink, G R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FUS3 represses CLN1 and CLN2 and in concert with KSS1 promotes signal transduction</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>Proc.

Either FUS3 or KSS1 can execute this function; when neither gene encoding these protein kinases is present, signal transduction is blocked, causing sterility. This functional redundancy is strain dependent; some standard laboratory strains (S288C) are kss1-. FUS3 has additional functions required for cell cycle arrest and vegetative growth that do not overlap with KSS1 functions. FUS3 mediates cell cycle arrest during mating through transcriptional repression of two G1 cyclins (CLN1 and CLN2) and through posttranscriptional inhibition of a third G1 cyclin (CLN3). FUS3 is also required for vegetative growth in haploid strains dependent upon CLN3 for cell cycle progression but is not required in strains dependent upon either CLN1 or CLN2, suggesting a functional divergence among the three G1 cyclins. The diverse roles for FUS3 suggest that the FUS3 protein kinase has multiple substrates, some of which may be shared with KSS1.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1946350</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Neiman, A M</author><author>Herskowitz, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reconstitution of a yeast protein kinase cascade in vitro: activation of the yeast MEK homologue STE7 by STE11</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title><short-title>Reconstitution of a yeast protein kinase cascade in vitro</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>Proc.

We have purified the yeast protein kinases encoded by STE11, STE7, and FUS3 as fusions to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and reconstituted a kinase cascade in which STE11 phosphorylates and activates STE7, which in turn phosphorylates the mitogen-activated protein kinase FUS3. GST-STE11 is active even when purified from cells that have not been treated with alpha-factor. This observation raises the possibility that STE11 activity is governed by an inhibitor which is regulated by pheromone. We also identify a STE11-dependent phosphorylation site in STE7 which is required for activity of STE7. Conservation of this site in the mammalian STE7 homologue MEK and other STE7 relatives suggests that this may be a regulatory phosphorylation site in all MAP kinase kinases.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8159759</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pryciak, P M</author><author>Huntress, F A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Membrane recruitment of the kinase cascade scaffold protein Ste5 by the Gbetagamma complex underlies activation of the yeast pheromone response pathway</title><secondary-title>Genes &amp; development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes &amp; development</full-title><abbr-1>Genes Dev.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2684-2697</pages><volume>12</volume><number>17</number><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</keyword><keyword>Recombinant Fusion Proteins</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Carrier Proteins</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Genotype</keyword><keyword>Peptides</keyword><keyword>Pheromones</keyword><keyword>Fungal Proteins</keyword><keyword>GTP-Binding Proteins</keyword><keyword>MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins</keyword><keyword>Sequence Alignment</keyword><keyword>Sequence Homology, Amino Acid</keyword><keyword>Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing</keyword><keyword>beta-Galactosidase</keyword><keyword>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein, Saccharomyces cerevisiae</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle Proteins</keyword><keyword>Crosses, Genetic</keyword><keyword>GTP Phosphohydrolases</keyword><keyword>Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors</keyword><keyword>Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins</keyword><keyword>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases</keyword><keyword>Proto-Oncogene Proteins</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>Sep 1, 1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0890-9369</isbn><abstract>In the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pheromone response pathway, the Gbetagamma complex activates downstream responses by an unknown mechanism involving a MAP kinase cascade, the PAK-like kinase Ste20, and a Rho family GTPase, Cdc42. Here we show that Gbetagamma must remain membrane-associated after release from Galpha to activate the downstream pathway. We also show that pheromone stimulates translocation of the kinase cascade scaffold protein Ste5 to the cell surface. This recruitment requires Gbetagamma function and the Gbetagamma-binding domain of Ste5, but not the kinases downstream of Gbetagamma, suggesting that it is mediated by Gbetagamma itself. Furthermore, this event has functional significance, as artificial targeting of Ste5 to the plasma membrane, but not intracellular membranes, activates the pathway in the absence of pheromone or Gbetagamma. Remarkably, although independent of Gbetagamma, activation by membrane-targeted Ste5 requires Ste20, Cdc42, and Cdc24, indicating that their participation in this pathway does not require them to be activated by Gbetagamma. Thus, membrane recruitment of Ste5 defines a molecular activity for Gbetagamma. Moreover, our results suggest that this event promotes kinase cascade activation by delivering the Ste5-associated kinases to the cell surface kinase Ste20, whose function may depend on Cdc42 and Cdc24.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9732267</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hirschman, J E</author><author>De Zutter, G S</author><author>Simonds, W F</author><author>Jenness, D D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The G beta gamma complex of the yeast pheromone response pathway.

However, as yet there is no direct biochemical evidence for a G betagamma protein complex associated with the plasma membrane. We found that the products of the STE4 and STE18 genes are stably associated with plasma membrane as well as with internal membranes and that 30% of the protein pool is not tightly associated with either membrane fraction. A slower-migrating, presumably phosphorylated, form of Ste4p is enriched in the non-membrane fraction. The Ste4p and Ste18p proteins that had been extracted from plasma membranes with detergent were found to co-sediment as an 8 S particle under low salt conditions and as a 6 S particle in the presence of 0.25 M NaCl; the Ste18p in these fractions was precipitated with anti-Ste4p antiserum. Under the conditions of our assay, Gpa1p was not associated with either particle. The levels of Ste4p and Ste18p accumulation in mutant cells provided additional evidence for a G betagamma complex. Ste18p failed to accumulate in ste4 mutant cells, and Ste4p showed reduced levels of accumulation and an increased rate of turnover in ste18 mutant cells. The gpa1 mutant blocked stable association of Ste4p with the plasma membrane, and the ste18 mutant blocked stable association of Ste4p with both plasma membranes and internal membranes. The membrane distribution of Ste4p was unaffected by the ste2 mutation or by down-regulation of the cell-surface receptors. These results indicate that at least 40% of Ste4p and Ste18p are part of a G betagamma complex at the plasma membrane and that stable association of this complex with the plasma membrane requires the presence of G alpha.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8995254</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burkholder, A C</author><author>Hartwell, L H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The yeast alpha-factor receptor: structural properties deduced from the sequence of the STE2 gene</title><secondary-title>Nucleic acids research</secondary-title><short-title>The yeast alpha-factor receptor</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic acids research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucleic Acids Res.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>8463-8475</pages><volume>13</volume><number>23</number><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Cell Surface</keyword><keyword>Protein Conformation</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Genes, Fungal</keyword><keyword>Peptides</keyword><keyword>Pheromones</keyword><keyword>Fungal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Genetic Complementation Test</keyword><keyword>Solubility</keyword><keyword>DNA, Fungal</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1985</year><pub-dates><date>Dec 9, 1985</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0305-1048</isbn><abstract>The STE2 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a component of the receptor for the oligopeptide pheromone alpha-factor.

In preclinical models, we have previously shown that transfection of T cells with mRNA coding for a CAR is an alternative strategy that has antitumor efficacy and the potential to evaluate the on-target off-tumor toxicity of new CAR targets safely due to transient mRNA CAR expression. Here, we report the safety observed in four patients treated with autologous T cells that had been electroporated with mRNA coding for a CAR derived from a murine antibody to human mesothelin. Because of the transient nature of CAR expression on the T cells, subjects in the clinical study were given repeated infusions of the CAR-T cells to assess their safety. One subject developed anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest within minutes of completing the third infusion. Although human anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies have been known to develop with CAR-transduced T cells, they have been thought to have no adverse clinical consequences. This is the first description of clinical anaphylaxis resulting from CAR-modified T cells, most likely through IgE antibodies specific to the CAR. These results indicate that the potential immunogenicity of CARs derived from murine antibodies may be a safety issue for mRNA CARs, especially when administered using an intermittent dosing schedule.

A set of conditions is described under which about one in every 400 plasmid molecules produces a transformed cell. These conditions include cell growth in medium containing elevated levels of Mg2+, and incubation of the cells at 0 degrees C in a solution of Mn2+, Ca2+, Rb+ or K+, dimethyl sulfoxide, dithiothreitol, and hexamine cobalt (III). Transformation efficiency declines linearly with increasing plasmid size. Relaxed and supercoiled plasmids transform with similar probabilities. Non-transforming DNAs compete consistent with mass. No significant variation is observed between competing DNAs of different source, complexity, length or form. Competition with both transforming and non-transforming plasmids indicates that each cell is capable of taking up many DNA molecules, and that the establishment of a transformation event is neither helped nor hindered significantly by the presence of multiple plasmids.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6345791</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Caterina, M J</author><author>Milne, J L</author><author>Devreotes, P N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mutation of the third intracellular loop of the cAMP receptor, cAR1, of Dictyostelium yields mutants impaired in multiple signaling pathways</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>J.

One member of this family, the cAMP receptor, cAR1, of Dictyostelium, mediates some responses (e.g. adenylyl cyclase activation, multicellular aggregation) which require G-proteins and others (e.g. Ca2+ influx, loss of ligand binding, cAR1 phosphorylation) which appear to be G-protein-independent. In this study, we randomly mutagenized the NH2-terminal eight amino acids of the third intracellular loop of cAR1 and examined the ability of these mutants to exhibit the three G-protein-independent responses listed above. Most mutants (classes I, II) exhibited wild-type or midly defective responses. Several mutants (class III), however, were severely impaired in all three processes but not in cAMP binding. Furthermore, these mutants failed to couple productively with G-proteins and could not replace cAR1 in a car1- cell. For these reasons, we propose that class III mutations interfere with the formation of an "active" conformation of the receptor.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8288619</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moorthy, Balakrishnan Shenbaga</author><author>Anand, Ganesh S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multistate Allostery in Response Regulators: Phosphorylation and Mutagenesis Activate RegA via Alternate Modes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Molecular Biology</secondary-title><short-title>Multistate Allostery in Response Regulators</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Molecular Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Molecular Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>468-487</pages><volume>417</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry</keyword><keyword>aromatic switch hypothesis</keyword><keyword>conformational selection</keyword><keyword>phosphoaspartate signaling</keyword><keyword>protein dynamics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>April 13, 2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-2836</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jmb.2012.01.052</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Response regulators (RRs) belong to two-component signaling pathways, widely prevalent in bacteria and lower eukaryotes, for sensing and mediating responses to diverse environmental stress stimuli. RRs are modular proteins, and in most instances, a receiver domain is found connected to diverse effector domain(s). All receiver domains contain a conserved aspartate, which is the site of phosphorylation by an associated histidine kinase. RRs function as phosphorylatable signaling switches whereby histidine-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of RRs alters its output function. It is largely unknown how phosphorylation of the receiver domain triggers activation of distally positioned effector domain(s). Although crystal structures have highlighted differences in conformations from comparisons of snapshots of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated receiver domains, how this is translated into altered activity of a distal effector domain has remained a mystery. While allosteric relays have been identified within receiver domains by NMR and X-ray crystallography, phosphorylated states of larger multidomain RRs have not yet been characterized. In this study, we have used amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe the conformational dynamics of a multidomain RR, RegA from Dictyostelium discoideum, by comparisons of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states and an activating mutant. Our results reveal allosteric coupling between the site of phosphorylation and the activating mutation. Interestingly, however, the conformations of the effector domains in both instances are distinct. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry indicates that the ‘inactive’ and ‘active’ conformations exist as ensembles of multiple conformations. This is consistent with the ‘conformational selection’ model for describing phosphorylation-dependent regulation of multidomain RRs.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283612001210</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\XDVBJZE3\Moorthy and Anand - 2012 - Multistate Allostery in Response Regulators Phosp.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\66XKCCFK\S0022283612001210.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-16 20:41:58</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Thesis">32</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Murithi, James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assaying for cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (RegA) Activity in Dictyostelium discoideum strains</title></titles><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>19/04/2013</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Amherst College</publisher></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saran, Shweta</author><author>Meima, Marcel E</author><author>Alvarez-Curto, Elisa</author><author>Weening, Karin E</author><author>Rozen, Daniel E</author><author>Schaap, Pauline</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>cAMP signaling in Dictyostelium.

The multitudinous functions of cAMP require precise spatial and temporal control of its production, degradation and detection. Many novel proteins have recently been identified that critically modulate the cAMP signal. We focus in this review on the properties and functions of the three adenylyl cyclases and the three cAMP-phosphodiesterases that are present in Dictyostelium, and the network of proteins that regulate the activity of these enzymes.

We have identified a cullin CulA that is required at several stages during Dictyostelium development. culA null cells are defective in inducing cell-type-specific gene expression and exhibit defects during aggregation, including reduced chemotaxis. PKA is an important regulator of Dictyostelium development. The levels of intracellular cAMP and PKA activity are controlled by the rate of synthesis of cAMP and its degradation by the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase RegA. We show that overexpression of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAcat) rescues many of the culA null defects and those of cells lacking FbxA/ChtA, a previously described F-box/WD40-repeat-containing protein, suggesting CulA and FbxA proteins are involved in regulating PKA function. Whereas RegA protein levels drop as the multicellular organism forms in the wild-type strain, they remain high in culA null and fbxA null cells. Although PKA can suppress the culA and fbxA null developmental phenotypes, it does not suppress the altered RegA degradation, suggesting that PKA lies downstream of RegA, CulA, and FbxA. Finally, we show that CulA, FbxA, and RegA are found in a complex in vivo, and formation of this complex is dependent on the MAP kinase ERK2, which is also required for PKA function. We propose that CulA and FbxA regulate multicellular development by targeting RegA for degradation via a pathway that requires ERK2 function, leading to an increase in cAMP and PKA activity.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11390363</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Podgorski, G J</author><author>Faure, M</author><author>Franke, J</author><author>Kessin, R H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase of Dictyostelium discoideum: the structure of the gene and its regulation and role in development</title><secondary-title>Developmental genetics</secondary-title><short-title>The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase of Dictyostelium discoideum</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Developmental genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Dev.

We have studied the biochemistry of the phosphodiesterase and a functionally related protein, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor protein, and have cloned the cognate genes. A 1.8-kb and a 2.2-kb mRNA are transcribed from the single-phosphodiesterase gene. The 2.2-kb mRNA comprises the majority of the phosphodiesterase mRNA found in differentiating cells and is transcribed only during development from a promoter at least 2.5 kb upstream of the translational start site. The 1.8-kb phosphodiesterase mRNA is detected at all stages of growth and development, is present at lower levels than the developmentally induced mRNA, and is transcribed from a site proximal to the protein-coding region. The phosphodiesterase gene contains a minimum of three exons, and a 2.3-kb intron, the longest yet reported for this organism. We have shown that the pdsA gene and four fgd genes affect the accumulation of the phosphodiesterase mRNAs, and we believe that these loci represent a significant portion of the genes regulating expression of the phosphodiesterase. The phosphodiesterase gene was introduced into cells by transformation and used as a tool to explore the effects of cAMP on the terminal stages of development. In cells expressing high levels of phosphodiesterase activity, final morphogenesis cannot be completed, and differentiated spore and stalk cells do not form. We interpret these results to support the hypothesis that cAMP plays an essential role in organizing cell movements in late development as well as in controlling the aggregation of cells in the initial phase of the developmental program.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2854019</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Koretke, K K</author><author>Lupas, A N</author><author>Warren, P V</author><author>Rosenberg, M</author><author>Brown, J R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolution of two-component signal transduction</title><secondary-title>Molecular biology and evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular biology and evolution</full-title><abbr-1>Mol.

These systems typically consist of a receptor histidine kinase, which reacts to an extracellular signal by phosphorylating a cytoplasmic response regulator, causing a change in cellular behavior. Although several model systems, including sporulation and chemotaxis, have been extensively studied, the evolutionary relationships between specific TCST systems are not well understood, and the ancestry of the signal transduction components is unclear. Phylogenetic trees of TCST components from 14 complete and 6 partial genomes, containing 183 histidine kinases and 220 response regulators, were constructed using distance methods. The trees showed extensive congruence in the positions of 11 recognizable phylogenetic clusters. Eukaryotic sequences were found almost exclusively in one cluster, which also showed the greatest extent of domain variability in its component proteins, and archaeal sequences mainly formed species-specific clusters. Three clusters in different parts of the kinase tree contained proteins with serine-phosphorylating activity. All kinases were found to be monophyletic with respect to other members of their superfamily, such as type II topoisomerases and Hsp90. Structural analysis further revealed significant similarity to the ATP-binding domain of eukaryotic protein kinases. TCST systems are of bacterial origin and radiated into archaea and eukaryotes by lateral gene transfer. Their components show extensive coevolution, suggesting that recombination has not been a major factor in their differentiation. Although histidine kinase activity is prevalent, serine kinases have evolved multiple times independently within this family, accompanied by a loss of the cognate response regulator(s). The structural and functional similarity between TCST kinases and eukaryotic protein kinases raises the possibility of a distant evolutionary relationship.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11110912</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ashenberg, Orr</author><author>Rozen-Gagnon, Kathryn</author><author>Laub, Michael T.</author><author>Keating, Amy E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determinants of Homodimerization Specificity in Histidine Kinases</title><secondary-title>Journal of Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Molecular Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>222-235</pages><volume>413</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>10/2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00222836</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jmb.2011.08.011</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>CrossRef</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022283611008783</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\KFIJVPIM\homodimerization specificity in HKs.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-16 18:56:07</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cai, Sheng Jian</author><author>Inouye, Masayori</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>EnvZ-OmpR interaction and osmoregulation in Escherichia coli</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Although both ompR and envZ genes are located on the ompB locus under the control of the ompB promoter and transcribed as a single polycistronic mRNA, the expression of envZ is known to be significantly less than ompR. However, to date no accurate estimation for the amounts of EnvZ and OmpR in the cell has been carried out. Here we examined the levels of EnvZ and OmpR in the wild-type strain MC4100 by quantitative Western blot analysis using anti-OmpR and anti-EnvZc (cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ) antisera. It was observed that during exponential growth in L-broth medium there were approximately 3500 and 100 molecules per cell of OmpR and EnvZ, respectively. The levels of OmpR and EnvZ in MC4100 cells grown in a high osmolarity medium (nutrient broth with 20% sucrose) were about the same as those grown in L-broth, whereas they were 1.7-fold higher than those in a low osmolarity medium (nutrient broth). With His10-OmpR, we also determined that the K(d) value for the EnvZc-OmpR complex formation is 1.20 +/- 0.17 microm. On the basis of these results, the molecular mechanism of osmoregulation of ompF and ompC is discussed.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11973328</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saito, Haruo</author><author>Posas, Francesc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Response to hyperosmotic stress</title><secondary-title>Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Genetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>289-318</pages><volume>192</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins</keyword><keyword>Cell Cycle Proteins</keyword><keyword>Osmolar Concentration</keyword><keyword>Adaptation, Physiological</keyword><keyword>Glycerol</keyword><keyword>p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Stress, Physiological</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>Oct 2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1943-2631</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1534/genetics.112.140863</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An appropriate response and adaptation to hyperosmolarity, i.e., an external osmolarity that is higher than the physiological range, can be a matter of life or death for all cells. It is especially important for free-living organisms such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When exposed to hyperosmotic stress, the yeast initiates a complex adaptive program that includes temporary arrest of cell-cycle progression, adjustment of transcription and translation patterns, and the synthesis and retention of the compatible osmolyte glycerol. These adaptive responses are mostly governed by the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which is composed of membrane-associated osmosensors, an intracellular signaling pathway whose core is the Hog1 MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade, and cytoplasmic and nuclear effector functions. The entire pathway is conserved in diverse fungal species, while the Hog1 MAPK cascade is conserved even in higher eukaryotes including humans. This conservation is illustrated by the fact that the mammalian stress-responsive p38 MAPK can rescue the osmosensitivity of hog1Δ mutations in response to hyperosmotic challenge. As the HOG pathway is one of the best-understood eukaryotic signal transduction pathways, it is useful not only as a model for analysis of osmostress responses, but also as a model for mathematical analysis of signal transduction pathways. In this review, we have summarized the current understanding of both the upstream signaling mechanism and the downstream adaptive responses to hyperosmotic stress in yeast.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23028184</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Downs, Jessica A</author><author>Kosmidou, Effie</author><author>Morgan, Alan</author><author>Jackson, Stephen P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Suppression of homologous recombination by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone</title><secondary-title>Molecular cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cell</full-title><abbr-1>Mol.

Chromatin is further condensed by association with linker histones. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hho1p has sequence homology to other known linker histones and interacts with nucleosomes in vitro. However, disruption of HHO1 results in no significant changes in the phenotypes examined thus far. Here, we show that Hho1p is inhibitory to DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). We find Hho1p is abundant and associated with the genome, consistent with a global role in DNA repair. Furthermore, we establish that Hho1p is required for a full life span and propose that this is mechanistically linked to its role in HR. Finally, we show that Hho1p is inhibitory to the recombination-dependent mechanism of telomere maintenance.

We have investigated the use of Phos-tag for detection and quantification of phospho-aspartate in response regulator proteins that function within two-component signaling systems. Alternative methods are especially important, because the labile nature of the acylphosphate bond in response regulator proteins has restricted the application of many traditional methods of phosphoprotein analysis. We demonstrate that Phos-tag gel stain can be used to detect phospho-Asp in response regulators and that Phos-tag acrylamide gel electrophoresis can be used to separate phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of response regulator proteins. The latter method, coupled to Western blot analysis, enables detection of specific phosphorylated proteins in complex mixtures such as cell lysates. Standards of phosphorylated proteins can be used to correct for hydrolysis of the labile phospho-Asp bond that invariably occurs during analysis. We have employed Phos-tag methods to characterize the phosphorylation state of the Escherichia coli response regulator PhoB both in vitro, using purified protein, and in vivo, by analyzing lysates of cells grown under different conditions of induction of the PhoR/PhoB phosphate assimilation pathway.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18328252</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shah-Mahoney, N</author><author>Hampton, T</author><author>Vidaver, R</author><author>Ratner, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Blocking the ends of transforming DNA enhances gene targeting in Dictyostelium</title><secondary-title>Gene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gene</full-title><abbr-1>Gene</abbr-1></periodical><pages>33-41</pages><volume>203</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>DNA</keyword><keyword>Transformation, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dictyostelium</keyword><keyword>Gene Targeting</keyword><keyword>Genetic Vectors</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>Dec 5, 1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1119</isbn><abstract>Eukaryotic gene targeting by means of gene replacement vectors is often complicated by unwanted plasmid insertion events involving the ends of transforming DNA molecules.

As a result, only one copy of the selectable gene is introduced at the target locus to achieve a precise gene disruption.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9426004</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wiegand, Stephan</author><author>Kruse, Janis</author><author>Gronemann, Sina</author><author>Hammann, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficient generation of gene knockout plasmids for Dictyostelium discoideum using one-step cloning</title><secondary-title>Genomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genomics</full-title><abbr-1>Genomics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>321-325</pages><volume>97</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Plasmids</keyword><keyword>Cloning, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dictyostelium</keyword><keyword>Genetic Vectors</keyword><keyword>Gene Deletion</keyword><keyword>Gene Knockout Techniques</keyword><keyword>Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>May 2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1089-8646</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.02.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a well-established model organism for studying numerous aspects of cellular and developmental functions. Its rather small (~34Mb) chromosomal genome and the high efficiency of gene disruption by homologous recombination have enabled researchers to dissect various specific gene functions. We describe here the use of one-step cloning for the fast and efficient generation of deletion vectors that are produced in a one-step reaction by inserting two PCR products into an organism-specific, generic acceptor system. This worked efficiently for all 16 tested constructs directed against genes in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Saving cost and time, the used protocol represents a significant advancement in the generation of such plasmids compared to the conventionally applied restriction enzyme/ligation approach. Using appropriate selection markers, similar systems could also be useful in other organisms, where genes can be knocked out by homologous recombination.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21316445</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Thesis">32</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ota, Mizuho</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigating the role of histidine kinases in the regulation  of multicellular development in D. discoideum:   Phenotypic analysis of dhkA- and dhkC- mutations in an fbxA-  genetic background</title></titles><pages>117</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>04/19/2013</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Amherst College</publisher><urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\BU5AIU3C\Mizuho Ota Thesis 2013 Revised.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>dsurujon/motifs</title><secondary-title>GitHub</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GitHub</full-title></periodical><dates/><abstract>motifs - Motif Finder</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://github.com/dsurujon/motifs</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\DDIZ4HET\motifs.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-14 16:52:16</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halabi, Najeeb</author><author>Rivoire, Olivier</author><author>Leibler, Stanislas</author><author>Ranganathan, Rama</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protein sectors: evolutionary units of three-dimensional structure</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title><short-title>Protein sectors</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title><abbr-1>Cell</abbr-1></periodical><pages>774-786</pages><volume>138</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-8-21</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0092-8674</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.038</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Proteins display a hierarchy of structural features at primary, secondary, tertiary, and higher-order levels, an organization that guides our current understanding of their biological properties and evolutionary origins. Here, we reveal a structural organization distinct from this traditional hierarchy by statistical analysis of correlated evolution between amino acids. Applied to the S1A serine proteases, the analysis indicates a decomposition of the protein into three quasi-independent groups of correlated amino acids that we term “protein sectors”. Each sector is physically connected in the tertiary structure, has a distinct functional role, and constitutes an independent mode of sequence divergence in the protein family. Functionally relevant sectors are evident in other protein families as well, suggesting that they may be general features of proteins.

Bacteria often employ tens or hundreds of these paralogous signaling systems, comprised of histidine kinases (HK) and their cognate response regulators (RR). Faithful transmission of information through these signaling pathways and avoidance of detrimental cross-talk demand exquisite specificity of HK-RR interactions. To identify the determinants of two-component signaling specificity, we examined patterns of amino acid coevolution in large multiple sequence alignments of cognate kinase-regulator pairs. Guided by these results, we demonstrate that a subset of the coevolving residues is sufficient, when mutated, to completely switch the substrate specificity of the kinase EnvZ. Our results shed light on the basis of molecular discrimination in two-component signaling pathways, provide a general approach for the rational rewiring of these pathways, and suggest that analyses of coevolution may facilitate the reprogramming of other signaling systems and protein-protein interactions.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2453690/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\H6XUZRMF\Skerker et al. - 2008 - Rewiring the Specificity of Two-Component Signal T.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2453690/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-13 23:01:43</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Zhi-hui</author><author>Schilde, Christina</author><author>Schaap, Pauline</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Functional Dissection of Adenylate Cyclase R, an Inducer of Spore Encapsulation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>J.

In Dictyostelium discoideum, adenylate cyclase R (ACR), is essential for spore encapsulation. In addition to its cyclase (AC) domain, ACR harbors seven transmembrane helices, a histidine kinase domain, and two receiver domains. We investigated the role of these domains in the regulation of AC activity. Expression of an ACR-YFP fusion protein in acr− cells rescued their sporulation defective phenotype and revealed that ACR is associated with the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum. Loss of the transmembrane helices (ΔTM) caused a 60% reduction of AC activity, but ΔTM-ACR still rescued the acr− phenotype. The isolated AC domain was properly expressed but inactive. Mutation of three essential ATP-binding residues in the histidine kinase domain did not affect the AC activity or phenotypic rescue. Mutation of the essential phosphoryl-accepting aspartate in receivers 1, 2, or both had only modest effects on AC activity and did not affect phenotypic rescue, indicating that AC activity is not critically regulated by phosphorelay. Remarkably, the dimerizing histidine phosphoacceptor subdomain, which in ACR lacks the canonical histidine for autophosphorylation, was essential for AC activity. Transformation of wild-type cells with an ACR allele (ΔCRA) that is truncated after this domain inhibited AC activity of endogenous ACR and replicated the acr− phenotype. Combined with the observation that the isolated AC domain was inactive, the dominant-negative effect of ΔCRA strongly suggests that the defunct phosphoacceptor domain acquired a novel role in enforcing dimerization of the AC domain.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.jbc.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jbc.org/content/285/53/41724</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6ZS582A9\Chen et al. - 2010 - Functional Dissection of Adenylate Cyclase R, an I.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20966074</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\676QP7P7\41724.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-13 20:27:06</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rot, Gregor</author><author>Parikh, Anup</author><author>Curk, Tomaz</author><author>Kuspa, Adam</author><author>Shaulsky, Gad</author><author>Zupan, Blaz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>dictyExpress: a Dictyostelium discoideum gene expression database with an explorative data analysis web-based interface</title><secondary-title>BMC Bioinformatics</secondary-title><short-title>dictyExpress</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Bioinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>265</pages><volume>10</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-08-25</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2105</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-10-265</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Bioinformatics often leverages on recent advancements in computer science to support biologists in their scientific discovery process.

Well-validated small RNA pathway cofactors such as these show distinctive patterns of conservation or divergence in particular animal, plant, fungal and protist species. We compared 86 divergent eukaryotic genome sequences to discern sets of proteins that show similar phylogenetic profiles with known small RNA cofactors. A large set of additional candidate small RNA cofactors have emerged from functional genomic screens for defects in miRNA- or short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated repression in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, and from proteomic analyses of proteins co-purifying with validated small RNA pathway proteins. The phylogenetic profiles of many of these candidate small RNA pathway proteins are similar to those of known small RNA cofactor proteins. We used a Bayesian approach to integrate the phylogenetic profile analysis with predictions from diverse transcriptional coregulation and proteome interaction data sets to assign a probability for each protein for a role in a small RNA pathway. Testing high-confidence candidates from this analysis for defects in RNAi silencing, we found that about one-half of the predicted small RNA cofactors are required for RNAi silencing. Many of the newly identified small RNA pathway proteins are orthologues of proteins implicated in RNA splicing. In support of a deep connection between the mechanism of RNA splicing and small-RNA-mediated gene silencing, the presence of the Argonaute proteins and other small RNA components in the many species analysed strongly correlates with the number of introns in those species.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11779.html</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\4M2DG79I\Tabach et al. - 2012 - Identification of small RNA pathway genes using pa.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\W5RITSZM\Tabach et al. - 2012 - Identification of small RNA pathway genes using pa.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2013-10-30 23:51:43</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Yu</author><author>Boguslawski, George</author><author>Zitomer, Richard S.</author><author>DePaoli-Roach, Anna A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Homologs of Mammalian B and B′ Subunits of Protein Phosphatase 2A Direct the Enzyme to Distinct Cellular Functions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Cloning of the mammalian B′ subunit has allowed the identification of a highly homologous Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, RTS1. Disruption of the gene results in a temperature-sensitive growth defect that can be suppressed by expression of rabbit B′α or B′γ isoforms. The B′α subunit is much more effective in restoring normal growth at 37 °C than B′γ. Immunoprecipitated Rts1p was found associated with type 2A-specific protein phosphatase activity that is sensitive to 2 nM okadaic acid, but not to 100 nM phosphatase inhibitor-2, and to be phosphorylated in vivo. However, overexpression of RTS1 was unable to suppress the cold sensitivity, defective cytokinesis, and abnormal cell morphology resulting from defects in the CDC55 gene, which encodes the yeast homolog of a different B subunit of another form of 2A phosphatase, PP2A1. These results indicate that Rts1p is a yeast homolog of the mammalian B′ subunit and that the various regulatory B-subunits of PP2A are not functionally redundant but direct the enzyme to distinct cellular functions.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.jbc.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jbc.org/content/272/13/8256</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\WARW2QEJ\Zhao et al. - 1997 - Saccharomyces cerevisiae Homologs of Mammalian B a.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9079645</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8ZGCTUAR\Zhao et al. - 1997 - Saccharomyces cerevisiae Homologs of Mammalian B a.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2013-10-25 16:17:40</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Millward, Thomas A</author><author>Zolnierowicz, Stanislaw</author><author>Hemmings, Brian A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regulation of protein kinase cascades by protein phosphatase 2A</title><secondary-title>Trends in Biochemical Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in Biochemical Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Trends in Biochemical Sciences</abbr-1></periodical><pages>186-191</pages><volume>24</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Signal Transduction</keyword><keyword>Cell cycle</keyword><keyword>Protein phosphatse 2A</keyword><keyword>Second messengers</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>May 1, 1999</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0968-0004</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0968-0004(99)01375-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many protein kinases themselves are regulated by reversible phosphorylation. Upon cell stimulation, specific kinases are transiently phosphorylated and activated. Several of these protein kinases are substrates for protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and PP2A appears to be the major kinase phosphatase in eukaryotic cells that downregulates activated protein kinases. This idea is substantiated by the observation that some viral proteins and naturally occurring toxins target PP2A and modulate its activity. There is increasing evidence that PP2A activity is regulated by extracellular signals and during the cell cycle. Thus, PP2A is likely to play an important role in determining the activation kinetics of protein kinase cascades.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000499013754</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\R6UG9GER\Millward et al. - 1999 - Regulation of protein kinase cascades by protein p.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\84TXDPEU\Millward et al. - 1999 - Regulation of protein kinase cascades by protein p.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2013-10-25 16:15:46</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yan, Y</author><author>Shay, J W</author><author>Wright, W E</author><author>Mumby, M C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibition of protein phosphatase activity induces p53-dependent apoptosis in the absence of p53 transactivation</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Exposure of Balb/c 3T3 cells to okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, increased the phosphorylation of p53 without changing p53 levels. Okadaic acid treatment enhanced the binding of p53 to a consensus DNA target sequence and caused a 5-8-fold increase in p53 transcriptional activity. Transient expression of SV40 small tumor antigen, a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, caused a 4-fold increase in p53 transcriptional activity. Incubation of Balb/c 3T3 cells with okadaic acid also induced programmed cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Decreases in viability, morphological changes, and the appearance of DNA fragmentation were dependent on p53 since cells lacking functional p53 were resistant to okadaic acid-induced apoptosis. The p53-dependent apoptosis induced by okadaic acid was rapid and did not require p53 transcriptional activity. The fact that SV40 small tumor antigen did not induce apoptosis provides additional evidence that p53 transcriptional activity is not sufficient for p53-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate that signaling pathways involving protein phosphorylation play critical roles in controlling the apoptotic activity of p53. Furthermore, a basal level of protein phosphatase 1 or 2A activity is necessary to prevent p53-dependent apoptosis.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Duong, François H T</author><author>Dill, Michael T</author><author>Matter, Matthias S</author><author>Makowska, Zuzanna</author><author>Calabrese, Diego</author><author>Dietsche, Tanja</author><author>Ketterer, Sylvia</author><author>Terracciano, Luigi</author><author>Heim, Markus H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protein phosphatase 2A promotes hepatocellular carcinogenesis in the diethylnitrosamine mouse model through inhibition of p53</title><secondary-title>Carcinogenesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Carcinogenesis</full-title><abbr-1>Carcinogenesis</abbr-1></periodical><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>Aug 31, 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1460-2180</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/carcin/bgt258</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Most HCCs develop in cirrhotic livers. Alcoholic liver disease, chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C are the most common underlying liver diseases. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific mechanisms that contribute to HCC are presently unknown. Transgenic expression of HCV proteins in the mouse liver induces an overexpression of the protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac). We have previously reported that HCV-induced PP2Ac overexpression modulates histone methylation and acetylation and inhibits DNA damage repair. In this study, we analyze tumor formation and gene expression using HCV transgenic mice that overexpress PP2Ac and liver tissues from patients with HCC. We demonstrate that PP2Ac overexpression interferes with p53-induced apoptosis. Injection of the carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine, induced significantly more and larger liver tumors in HCV transgenic mice that overexpress PP2Ac compared with control mice. In human liver biopsies from patients with HCC, PP2Ac expression was significantly higher in HCC tissue compared with non-tumorous liver tissue from the same patients. Our findings demonstrate an important role of PP2Ac overexpression in liver carcinogenesis and provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HCV-induced HCC.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>ENG</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23901063</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Millward, T A</author><author>Zolnierowicz, S</author><author>Hemmings, B A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regulation of protein kinase cascades by protein phosphatase 2A</title><secondary-title>Trends in biochemical sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in biochemical sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Trends Biochem.

Upon cell stimulation, specific kinases are transiently phosphorylated and activated. Several of these protein kinases are substrates for protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and PP2A appears to be the major kinase phosphatase in eukaryotic cells that downregulates activated protein kinases. This idea is substantiated by the observation that some viral proteins and naturally occurring toxins target PP2A and modulate its activity. There is increasing evidence that PP2A activity is regulated by extracellular signals and during the cell cycle. Thus, PP2A is likely to play an important role in determining the activation kinetics of protein kinase cascades.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10322434</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><titles><title>The cyclin-dependent kinase family in the social amoebozoan Dictyostelium discoideum - Springer</title></titles><dates/><remote-database-name>link.springer.com</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00018-013-1449-3/fulltext.html</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TQIVXNR5\The cyclin-dependent kinase family in the social a.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2013-10-24 17:36:05</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukuzawa, Masashi</author><author>Araki, Tsuyoshi</author><author>Adrian, Iris</author><author>Williams, Jeffrey G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tyrosine Phosphorylation-Independent Nuclear Translocation of a&lt; i&gt; Dictyostelium&lt;/i&gt; STAT in Response to DIF Signaling</title><secondary-title>Molecular cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular cell</full-title></periodical><pages>779–788</pages><volume>7</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>Google Scholar</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276501002222</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\BG9NTM4U\1-s2.0-S1097276501002222-main.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2013-07-17 16:35:37</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aaronson, D.

of the Mexican hat. This corresponds to a commitment step in morphogenesis that irreversibly signals progression from the slug stage to the fruiting body. We describe the characterization of the dhkK gene that controls this morphogenetic step. Null mutants of dhkK repeatedly attempt, and fail, to undergo morphogenesis from the slug to the Mexican hat, causing them to exhibit a “slugger” phenotype, which cannot be corrected by co-development with wild-type cells. The dhkK gene encodes a putative receptor histidine kinase whose expression is enriched in prestalk cells in the slug. Uniquely for a histidine kinase, DhkK is located in the nuclear envelope. Entry into culmination requires the DhkK response regulator domain, which appears to directly regulate cyclic AMP signaling.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160606000200</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\9UUQNWX8\Thomason et al. - 2006 - The histidine kinase homologue DhkKSombrero contr.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ZMKHSQXZ\S0012160606000200.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-13 19:25:42</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Loomis, William F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of PKA in the Timing of Developmental Events in Dictyostelium Cells</title><secondary-title>Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews</full-title><abbr-1>Microbiol.

The catalytic subunit of PKA is inhibited when associated with its regulatory subunit but is activated when cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit. Deletion of pkaR or overexpression of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit, pkaC, results in constitutive activity. Development is independent of cAMP in strains carrying these genetic alterations and proceeds rapidly to the formation of both spores and stalk cells. However, morphogenesis is aberrant in these mutants. In the wild type, PKA activity functions in a circuit that can spontaneously generate pulses of cAMP necessary for long-range aggregation. It is also essential for transcriptional activation of both prespore and prestalk genes during the slug stage. During culmination, PKA functions in both prespore and prestalk cells to regulate the relative timing of terminal differentiation. A positive feedback loop results in the rapid release of a signal peptide, SDF-2, when prestalk cells are exposed to low levels of SDF-2. The signal transduction pathway that mediates the response to SDF-2 in both prestalk and prespore cells involves the two-component system of DhkA and RegA. When the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA is inhibited, cAMP accumulates and activates PKA, leading to vacuolation of stalk cells and encapsulation of spores. These studies indicate that multiple inputs regulate PKA activity to control the relative timing of differentiations in Dictyostelium.</abstract><remote-database-name>mmbr.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://mmbr.asm.org/content/62/3/684</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\VKBFGPNA\Loomis - 1998 - Role of PKA in the Timing of Developmental Events .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9729606</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ICK63JHH\684.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-13 18:53:24</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laub, Michael T.</author><author>Loomis, William F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Molecular Network That Produces Spontaneous Oscillations in Excitable Cells of Dictyostelium</title><secondary-title>Molecular Biology of the Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Biology of the Cell</full-title><abbr-1>Mol.

Previous biochemical assays have shown that when extracellular adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) binds to the surface receptor CAR1, adenylyl cyclase and the MAP kinase ERK2 are transiently activated. A rise in the internal concentration of cAMP activates protein kinase A such that it inhibits ERK2 and leads to a loss-of-ligand binding by CAR1. ERK2 phosphorylates the cAMP phosphodiesterase REG A that reduces the internal concentration of cAMP. A secreted phosphodiesterase reduces external cAMP concentrations between pulses. Numerical solutions to a series of nonlinear differential equations describing these activities faithfully account for the observed periodic changes in cAMP. The activity of each of the components is necessary for the network to generate oscillatory behavior; however, the model is robust in that 25-fold changes in the kinetic constants linking the activities have only minor effects on the predicted frequency. Moreover, constant high levels of external cAMP lead to attenuation, whereas a brief pulse of cAMP can advance or delay the phase such that interacting cells become entrained.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.molbiolcell.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/9/12/3521</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PSXPJ5DT\Laub and Loomis - 1998 - A Molecular Network That Produces Spontaneous Osci.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9843585</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SIP3QS6B\3521.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-13 17:28:51</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roos, W.</author><author>Malchow, D.</author><author>Gerisch, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adenylyl cyclase and the control of cell differentiation in Dictyostelium discoideum</title><secondary-title>Cell Differentiation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Differentiation</full-title><abbr-1>Cell Differentiation</abbr-1></periodical><pages>229-239</pages><volume>6</volume><number>3–4</number><issue>3–4</issue><dates><year>1977</year><pub-dates><date>October 1977</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-6039</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0045-6039(77)90018-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Adenylyl cyclase is part of a biochemical network that controls cell differentiation in Dictyostelium discoideum. At a certain stage of development the enzyme is rhythmically activated, with periods of about 8 min. These oscillations are superimposed upon an increase of the basal activity extending over a period of hours. The basal activity remains low in a mutant blocked at an early stage of development. In strain Ax-2 two periods of strongly increasing basal activity have been found: the first from 2 to 4 h after the end of the growth phase, the other begining at about 8 h.&#xD;Based on the periodic regulation of adenylyl cyclase, cyclic AMP is released into the extracellular space in the form of pulses. Application of cyclic-AMP pulses, but not its continuous influx, stimulates the increase of basal adenylyl cyclase activity. Two other constituents of the cyclic-AMP signal system, cyclic-AMP receptors and cell-surface phosphodiesterase, are similarly controlled. The principal importance of positive feedback loops in a network controlling cell differentiation is discussed.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0045603977900185</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\28ZCC8DM\0045603977900185.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-13 17:27:32</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parent, C A</author><author>Devreotes, P N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular genetics of signal transduction in Dictyostelium</title><secondary-title>Annual review of biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual review of biochemistry</full-title><abbr-1>Annu.

In the Dictyostelium genome, there are five genes that encode putative ammonium transporters: amtA, amtB, amtC, rhgA, and rhgB. Here, we show that AmtA regulates ammonia homeostasis during growth and development. We found that cells lacking amtA had increased levels of ammonia/ammonium, whereas their extracellular ammonia/ammonium levels were highly decreased. These results suggest that AmtA mediates the excretion of ammonium. In support of a role for AmtA in ammonia homeostasis, AmtA mRNA is expressed throughout the life cycle, and its expression level increases during development. Importantly, AmtA-mediated ammonia homeostasis is critical for many developmental processes. amtA− cells are more sensitive to NH4Cl than wild-type cells in inhibition of chemotaxis toward cyclic AMP and of formation of multicellular aggregates. Furthermore, even in the absence of exogenously added ammonia, we found that amtA− cells produced many small fruiting bodies and that the viability and germination of amtA− spores were dramatically compromised. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that AmtA regulates ammonia homeostasis and plays important roles in multiple developmental processes in Dictyostelium.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2168237/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\F3MCA9X2\Yoshino et al. - 2007 - Regulation of Ammonia Homeostasis by the Ammonium .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2168237/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-07 21:54:52</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schindler, J</author><author>Sussman, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ammonia determines the choice of morphogenetic pathways in Dictyostelium discoideum</title><secondary-title>Journal of molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of molecular biology</full-title><abbr-1>J.

The aggregate formation is mediated by directional migration of individual cells that quickly transition to group migration in which cells align in a head-to-tail manner to form streams. Cyclic AMP acts as a chemoattractant and its production, secretion, and degradation are highly regulated. A key protein is the extracellular phosphodiesterase PdsA. In this study we examine the role and localization of PdsA during chemotaxis and streaming. We find that pdsA− cells respond chemotactically to a narrower range of chemoattractant concentrations compared with wild-type (WT) cells. Moreover, unlike WT cells, pdsA− cells do not form streams at low cell densities and form unusual thick and transient streams at high cell densities. We find that the intracellular pool of PdsA is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, which may provide a compartment for storage and secretion of PdsA. Because we find that cAMP synthesis is normal in cells lacking PdsA, we conclude that signal degradation regulates the external cAMP gradient field generation and that the group migration behavior of these cells is compromised even though their signaling machinery is intact.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2710833/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\AHCDS555\Garcia et al. - 2009 - The Group Migration of Dictyostelium Cells Is Regu.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2710833/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-07 20:58:27</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Phoenix, D A</author><author>Harris, F</author><author>Daman, O A</author><author>Wallace, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The prediction of amphiphilic alpha-helices</title><secondary-title>Current protein &amp; peptide science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current protein &amp; peptide science</full-title><abbr-1>Curr.

Earlier techniques attempted to detect the characteristic periodicity in hydrophobic amino acid residues shown by these structure and included the Molecular Hydrophobic Potential (MHP), which represents the hydrophobicity of amino acid residues as lines of isopotential around the alpha-helix and analyses based on Fourier transforms. These latter analyses compare the periodicity of hydrophobic residues in a putative alpha-helical sequence with that of a test mathematical function to provide a measure of amphiphilicity using either the Amphipathic Index or the Hydrophobic Moment. More recently, the introduction of computational procedures based on techniques such as hydropathy analysis, homology modelling, multiple sequence alignments and neural networks has led to the prediction of transmembrane alpha-helices with accuracies of the order of 95% and transmembrane protein topology with accuracies greater than 75%. Statistical approaches to transmembrane protein modeling such as hidden Markov models have increased these prediction levels to an even higher level. Here, we review a number of these predictive techniques and consider problems associated with their use in the prediction of structure / function relationships, using alpha-helices from G-coupled protein receptors, penicillin binding proteins, apolipoproteins, peptide hormones, lytic peptides and tilted peptides as examples.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12188904</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Janiak-Spens, Fabiola</author><author>Sparling, Jeffrey M.</author><author>Gurfinkel, Michael</author><author>West, Ann H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Differential Stabilities of Phosphorylated Response Regulator Domains Reflect Functional Roles of the Yeast Osmoregulatory SLN1 and SSK1 Proteins</title><secondary-title>Journal of Bacteriology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Bacteriology</full-title><abbr-1>J.

The SLN1-YPD1-SSK1 phosphorelay regulates a downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade which ultimately controls the concentration of glycerol within the cell under hyperosmotic stress conditions. The C-terminal response regulator domains of SLN1 and SSK1 and full-length YPD1 have been overexpressed and purified from E. coli. A heterologous system consisting of acetyl phosphate, the bacterial chemotaxis response regulator CheY, and YPD1 has been developed as an efficient means of phosphorylating SLN1 and SSK1 in vitro. The homologous regulatory domains of SLN1 and SSK1 exhibit remarkably different phosphorylated half-lives, a finding that provides insight into the distinct roles that these phosphorylation-dependent regulatory domains play in the yeast osmosensory signal transduction pathway.</abstract><remote-database-name>jb.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://jb.asm.org/content/181/2/411</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\R5JIZUD6\Janiak-Spens et al. - 1999 - Differential Stabilities of Phosphorylated Respons.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9882653</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\2N7S8KS5\411.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-07 19:49:27</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhu, Yan</author><author>Qin, Ling</author><author>Yoshida, Takeshi</author><author>Inouye, Masayori</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phosphatase activity of histidine kinase EnvZ without kinase catalytic domain</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>PNAS</abbr-1></periodical><pages>7808-7813</pages><volume>97</volume><number>14</number><issue>14</issue><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>07/05/2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424, 1091-6490</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.97.14.7808</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Most histidine kinases are bifunctional enzymes having both kinase and phosphatase activities. The cytoplasmic kinase domain of EnvZ, a transmembrane histidine kinase functioning as an osmosensor in Escherichia coli, consists of two distinct functional subdomains: domain A [EnvZc(223–289)] and domain B [EnvZc(290–450)]. NMR studies demonstrated that domain A consists of a four-helix bundle serving as a dimerization and phosphotransfer domain, and domain B functions as the ATP-binding and catalytic domain. Here we demonstrate that domain A by itself has the phosphatase activity both in vitro and in vivo. This phosphatase activity is Mg2+ dependent but is not activated by ADP, ATP, or adenosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate (AMPPNP), each of which may serve as a cofactor for the EnvZ phosphatase activity. Domain B showed a small but distinct effect on the domain A phosphatase activity only in the presence of ADP or AMPPNP. However, when domain B was covalently linked to domain A, dramatic cofactor-dependent enhancement of the phosphatase activity was observed. Extending domain A for another 75 residues at the C terminus or 44 residues at the N terminus did not enhance its phosphatase activity. Substitution mutations at His-243, the autophosphorylation site, demonstrate that the His residue plays an essential role in the phosphatase activity. The so-called X-region mutant L288P that is known to specifically abolish the phosphatase activity in EnvZ had no effect on the domain A phosphatase function. We propose that the EnvZ phosphatase activity is regulated by relative positioning of domains A and B, which is controlled by external signals. We also propose that the His-243 residue participates in both kinase and phosphatase reactions.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/97/14/7808</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6BC9GCDX\Zhu et al. - 2000 - Phosphatase activity of histidine kinase EnvZ with.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10884412</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PP9TPW5H\7808.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-07 16:57:30</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuspa, A.</author><author>Loomis, W.

We have found that electroporating BamHI or EcoRI together with pyr5-6 plasmids cut with the same enzyme stimulates the efficiency of transformation in Dictyostelium discoideum more than 20-fold over the rate seen when plasmid DNA alone is introduced. Restriction enzyme-mediated integration generates insertions into genomic restriction sites in an apparently random manner, some of which cause mutations. About 1 in 400 of the Dictyostelium transformants displayed arrested or aberrant development. The integrated plasmid, along with flanking genomic DNA, was excised from some of these mutants, cloned in Escherichia coli, and used to transform other Dictyostelium cells. Homologous recombination within the flanking sequences resulted in the same phenotypes displayed by the original mutants, directly demonstrating that the affected genes were responsible for the specific morphological phenotypes. This method of insertional mutagenesis should be useful for tagging, and subsequent cloning, of many developmentally important genes that can be identified by their mutant phenotypes.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/89/18/8803</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\2D6P3MBQ\Kuspa and Loomis - 1992 - Tagging developmental genes in Dictyostelium by re.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1326764</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8SZXWHAH\8803.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-07 01:27:58</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hobson, David J.</author><author>Wei, Wu</author><author>Steinmetz, Lars M.</author><author>Svejstrup, Jesper Q.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RNA Polymerase II Collision Interrupts Convergent Transcription</title><secondary-title>Molecular Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>365-374</pages><volume>48</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>09/11/2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1097-2765</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.molcel.2012.08.027</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Antisense noncoding transcripts, genes-within-genes, and convergent gene pairs are prevalent among eukaryotes. The existence of such transcription units raises the question of what happens when RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) molecules collide head-to-head. Here we use a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches in yeast to show that polymerases transcribing opposite DNA strands cannot bypass each other. RNAPII stops but does not dissociate upon head-to-head collision in vitro, suggesting that opposing polymerases represent insurmountable obstacles for each other. Head-to-head collision in vivo also results in RNAPII stopping, and removal of collided RNAPII from the DNA template can be achieved via ubiquitylation-directed proteolysis. Indeed, in cells lacking efficient RNAPII polyubiquitylation, the half-life of collided polymerases increases, so that they can be detected between convergent genes. These results provide insight into fundamental mechanisms of gene traffic control and point to an unexplored effect of antisense transcription on gene regulation via polymerase collision.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.cell.com</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cell.com/article/S1097276512007708/abstract</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\9HS6PDQC\Hobson et al. - 2012 - RNA Polymerase II Collision Interrupts Convergent .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23041286</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\WBPQNFKQ\Hobson et al. - 2012 - RNA Polymerase II Collision Interrupts Convergent .html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-06 18:33:00</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hsu, Duen-Wei</author><author>Kiely, Rhian</author><author>Couto, C Anne-Marie</author><author>Wang, Hong-Yu</author><author>Hudson, Jessica J R</author><author>Borer, Christine</author><author>Pears, Catherine J</author><author>Lakin, Nicholas D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice in Dictyostelium</title><secondary-title>Journal of cell science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of cell science</full-title><abbr-1>J.

The mechanisms that govern whether a DSB is repaired by NHEJ or HR remain unclear. Here, we characterise DSB repair in the amoeba Dictyostelium. HR is the principal pathway responsible for resistance to DSBs during vegetative cell growth, a stage of the life cycle when cells are predominantly in G2. However, we illustrate that restriction-enzyme-mediated integration of DNA into the Dictyostelium genome is possible during this stage of the life cycle and that this is mediated by an active NHEJ pathway. We illustrate that Dclre1, a protein with similarity to the vertebrate NHEJ factor Artemis, is required for NHEJ independently of DNA termini complexity. Although vegetative dclre1(-) cells are not radiosensitive, they exhibit delayed DSB repair, further supporting a role for NHEJ during this stage of the life cycle. By contrast, cells lacking the Ku80 component of the Ku heterodimer that binds DNA ends to facilitate NHEJ exhibit no such defect and deletion of ku80 suppresses the DSB repair defect of dclre1(-) cells through increasing HR efficiency. These data illustrate a functional NHEJ pathway in vegetative Dictyostelium and the importance of Ku in regulating DSB repair choice during this phase of the life cycle.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21536833</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dessimoz, Christophe</author><author>Gabaldón, Toni</author><author>Roos, David S.</author><author>Sonnhammer, Erik L.

The orotidine-5'-phosphate carboxy-lyase and the orotate phosphoribosyl transferase activities that result from Dictyostelium gene expression in yeast have been detected. The size of the DNA required for both complementations has been localised to a segment of less than 2 kb. A unique Dictyostelium RNA species of 1,600 base pairs hybridizes to this fragment. In vitro deletions in this fragment lead to the simultaneous loss of the two activities. The two enzymatic activities coelute as a protein of 120,000 daltons during gel filtration of a Dictyostelium extract. These results favour the existence, on the cloned Dictyostelium DNA fragment, of a unique structural gene which codes for a bifunctional enzyme carrying the two activities, orotidine-5'-phosphate carboxy-lyase and orotate phosphoribosyl transferase.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6323917</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schaap, Pauline</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolutionary crossroads in developmental biology: Dictyostelium discoideum</title><secondary-title>Development (Cambridge, England)</secondary-title><short-title>Evolutionary crossroads in developmental biology</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Development (Cambridge, England)</full-title><abbr-1>Development</abbr-1></periodical><pages>387-396</pages><volume>138</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-2-1</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0950-1991</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1242/dev.048934</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Dictyostelium discoideum belongs to a group of multicellular life forms that can also exist for long periods as single cells.

We show that a transient intracellular cAMP signal, dependent on the presence of DokA, is generated in response to an osmotic shock. This variation of cAMP levels contributes to survival under hypertonic conditions. In contrast to the low cAMP levels observed in dokA− strains, overexpression of the receiver domain of DokA causes an increase in cAMP levels, resulting in a rapidly developing phenotype. We present biochemical and cell biological data indicating that the DokA receiver domain is a dominant‐negative regulator of a phosphorelay, which controls the intracellular cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA. The activity of the DokA receiver domain depends on a conserved aspartate, mutation of which reverses the developmental phenotype, as well as the deregulation of cAMP metabolism.</abstract><remote-database-name>emboj.embopress.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://emboj.embopress.org/content/19/21/5782</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\DFUM5SM8\Ott et al. - 2000 - Osmotic stress response in Dictyostelium is mediat.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11060029</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PUN4I7WP\5782.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-04 17:29:12</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kirsten, Janet H.</author><author>Xiong, Yanhua</author><author>Dunbar, Andrew J.</author><author>Rai, Meena</author><author>Singleton, Charles K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ammonium transporter C of Dictyostelium discoideum is required for correct prestalk gene expression and for regulating the choice between slug migration and culmination</title><secondary-title>Developmental Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Developmental Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Developmental Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>146-156</pages><volume>287</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Dictyostelium</keyword><keyword>Histidine kinase</keyword><keyword>Phosphorelay</keyword><keyword>Ammonia</keyword><keyword>Adenylyl cyclase</keyword><keyword>Ammonium transporter</keyword><keyword>CudA</keyword><keyword>DhkC</keyword><keyword>STATa</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>November 1, 2005</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0012-1606</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.08.043</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Ammonium transporter C (AmtC) is one of three transporters in Dictyostelium that have been proposed to regulate entry and exit of ammonia in a cell type dependent manner and to mediate ammonia signaling. Previous work demonstrated that disruption of the amtC gene results in a slugger phenotype in which the cells remain as migrating slugs when they should form fruiting bodies. More detailed studies on the null strain revealed that differentiation of prestalk cell types was delayed and maintenance of prestalk cell gene expression was defective. There was little or no expression of ecmB, a marker for the initiation of culmination. Normal expression of CudA, a nuclear protein required for culmination, was absent in the anterior prestalk zone. The absence of CudA within the tip region was attributable to the lack of nuclear localization of the transcription factor STATa, despite expression of adenylyl cyclase A mRNA in the slug tips. Disruption of the histidine kinase gene dhkC in the amtC null strain restored STATa and CudA expression and the ability to culminate. The results suggest that the lack of nuclear translocation of STATa results from low cAMP due to a misregulated and overactive DhkC phosphorelay in the amtC null strain.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160605005701</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\UJRUQ8NK\Kirsten et al. - 2005 - Ammonium transporter C of Dictyostelium discoideum.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NX6EVEVB\S0012160605005701.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-04 15:57:32</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coukell, M.

The catalytic subunit of PKA is inhibited when associated with its regulatory subunit but is activated when cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit. Deletion of pkaR or overexpression of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit, pkaC, results in constitutive activity. Development is independent of cAMP in strains carrying these genetic alterations and proceeds rapidly to the formation of both spores and stalk cells. However, morphogenesis is aberrant in these mutants. In the wild type, PKA activity functions in a circuit that can spontaneously generate pulses of cAMP necessary for long-range aggregation. It is also essential for transcriptional activation of both prespore and prestalk genes during the slug stage. During culmination, PKA functions in both prespore and prestalk cells to regulate the relative timing of terminal differentiation. A positive feedback loop results in the rapid release of a signal peptide, SDF-2, when prestalk cells are exposed to low levels of SDF-2. The signal transduction pathway that mediates the response to SDF-2 in both prestalk and prespore cells involves the two-component system of DhkA and RegA. When the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA is inhibited, cAMP accumulates and activates PKA, leading to vacuolation of stalk cells and encapsulation of spores. These studies indicate that multiple inputs regulate PKA activity to control the relative timing of differentiations in Dictyostelium.</abstract><remote-database-name>mmbr.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://mmbr.asm.org/content/62/3/684</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\RR8GGNUV\Loomis - 1998 - Role of PKA in the Timing of Developmental Events .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9729606</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\CFAN7WQF\684.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-01 23:09:07</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Matsushika, Akinori</author><author>Mizuno, Takeshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Dual-Signaling Mechanism Mediated by the ArcB Hybrid Sensor Kinase Containing the Histidine-Containing Phosphotransfer Domain in Escherichia coli</title><secondary-title>Journal of Bacteriology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Bacteriology</full-title><abbr-1>J Bacteriol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>3973-3977</pages><volume>180</volume><number>15</number><issue>15</issue><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998-8</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-9193</isbn><abstract>The two components ArcB and ArcA play a crucial role in the signal transduction implicated in the complex transcriptional regulatory network that allows Escherichia coli to sense various respiratory growth conditions. ArcB is a hybrid sensor kinase having multiple phosphorylation sites in its primary amino acid sequence, including a transmitter, a receiver, and a histidine-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) domain. ArcA is a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator with a receiver domain. Results of recent in vitro studies revealed multistep His-to-Asp phosphotransfer circuitry in the ArcB-ArcA signaling system. For this report we conducted a series of in vivo experiments using a set of crucial ArcB mutants to evaluate the regulation of the sdh operon. The results suggested that the phosphorylated His-717 site in the HPt domain of ArcB is essential for anaerobic repression of sdh. Nonetheless, the ArcB mutant lacking this crucial His-717 site does not necessarily exhibit a null phenotype with respect to ArcB-ArcA signaling. The HPt mutant appears to maintain an ability to signal ArcA, particularly under aerobic conditions, which results in a significant repression of sdh. Based on these and other in vivo results, we propose a model in which ArcB functions in its own right as a dual-signaling sensor that is capable of propagating two types of stimuli through two distinct phosphotransfer pathways.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC107383/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\QQA4HT4J\Matsushika and Mizuno - 1998 - A Dual-Signaling Mechanism Mediated by the ArcB Hy.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC107383/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-04-01 22:45:13</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yamamoto, Kaneyoshi</author><author>Hirao, Kiyo</author><author>Oshima, Taku</author><author>Aiba, Hirofumi</author><author>Utsumi, Ryutaro</author><author>Ishihama, Akira</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Functional Characterization in Vitro of All Two-component Signal Transduction Systems from Escherichia coli</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biological Chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Each two-component system consists of a sensor protein-histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR), together forming a signal transduction pathway via histidyl-aspartyl phospho-relay. A total of 30 sensor HKs, including as yet uncharacterized putative HKs (BaeS, BasS, CreC, CusS, HydH, RstB, YedV, and YfhK), and a total of 34 RRs, including putative RRs (BaeR, BasR, CreB, CusR, HydG, RstA, YedW, YfhA, YgeK, and YhjB), have been suggested to exist in Escherichia coli. We have purified the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of 27 sensor HKs and the full-length protein of all 34 RRs to apparent homogeneity. Self-phosphorylation in vitro was detected for 25 HKs. The rate of self-phosphorylation differed among HKs, whereas the level of phosphorylation was generally co-related with the phosphorylation rate. However, the phosphorylation level was low for ArcB, HydH, NarQ, and NtrB even though the reaction rate was fast, whereas the level was high for the slow phosphorylation species BasS, CheA, and CreC. By using the phosphorylated HKs, we examined trans-phosphorylation in vitro of RRs for all possible combinations. Trans-phosphorylation of presumed cognate RRs by HKs was detected, for the first time, for eight pairs, BaeS-BaeR, BasS-BasR, CreC-CreB, CusS-CusR, HydH-HydG, RstB-RstA, YedV-YedW, and YfhK-YfhA. All trans-phosphorylation took place within less than 1/2 min, but the stability of phosphorylated RRs differed, indicating the involvement of de-phosphorylation control. In addition to the trans-phosphorylation between the cognate pairs, we detected trans-phosphorylation between about 3% of non-cognate HK-RR pairs, raising the possibility that the cross-talk in signal transduction takes place between two-component systems.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.jbc.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jbc.org/content/280/2/1448</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\CWPHMNME\Yamamoto et al. - 2005 - Functional Characterization in Vitro of All Two-co.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15522865</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\FWXFS7GA\Yamamoto et al. - 2005 - Functional Characterization in Vitro of All Two-co.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-03-24 14:10:55</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pei, Jimin</author><author>Grishin, Nick V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PROMALS: towards accurate multiple sequence alignments of distantly related proteins</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics</secondary-title><short-title>PROMALS</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics</full-title><abbr-1>Bioinformatics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>802-808</pages><volume>23</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>04/01/2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1367-4803, 1460-2059</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btm017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Motivation: Accurate multiple sequence alignments are essential in protein structure modeling, functional prediction and efficient planning of experiments. Although the alignment problem has attracted considerable attention, preparation of high-quality alignments for distantly related sequences remains a difficult task.&#xD;Results: We developed PROMALS, a multiple alignment method that shows promising results for protein homologs with sequence identity below 10%, aligning close to half of the amino acid residues correctly on average. This is about three times more accurate than traditional pairwise sequence alignment methods. PROMALS algorithm derives its strength from several sources: (i) sequence database searches to retrieve additional homologs; (ii) accurate secondary structure prediction; (iii) a hidden Markov model that uses a novel combined scoring of amino acids and secondary structures; (iv) probabilistic consistency-based scoring applied to progressive alignment of profiles. Compared to the best alignment methods that do not use secondary structure prediction and database searches (e.g. MUMMALS, ProbCons and MAFFT), PROMALS is up to 30% more accurate, with improvement being most prominent for highly divergent homologs. Compared to SPEM and HHalign, which also employ database searches and secondary structure prediction, PROMALS shows an accuracy improvement of several percent.&#xD;Availability: The PROMALS web server is available at: http://prodata.swmed.edu/promals/&#xD;Contact: jpei@chop.swmed.edu&#xD;Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</abstract><remote-database-name>bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/7/802</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\BJJ86MH5\Pei and Grishin - 2007 - PROMALS towards accurate multiple sequence alignm.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17267437</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ZJ7QPU79\Pei and Grishin - 2007 - PROMALS towards accurate multiple sequence alignm.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-03-11 00:57:50</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Altschul, S F</author><author>Gish, W</author><author>Miller, W</author><author>Myers, E W</author><author>Lipman, D J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Basic local alignment search tool</title><secondary-title>Journal of molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of molecular biology</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Neurtral red staining as well as immunostaining with antisera prepared against spores or a spore-coat protein has indicated that there are cells in the posterior region which have properties similar to prestalk cells. This cell population, called anterior-like cells, has been isolated by density separation of posterior slug fractions. This anterior-like cell preparation contained approximately 80% neutral red-stained cells, none of which carried a surface antigen specific to prespore cells (MUD-1 antigen). These cells also lacked antigens recognized by antisera to the spore-coat proteins or by a prespore-specific monoclonal antibody isolated for this study (mLJ1). Anterior-like cells were found to modify the lysosomal enzymes acid phosphatase and α-mannosidase in a manner found specifically in prestalk cells. They also synthesized two prestalk-specific proteins and contain two prestalk-specific mRNA transcripts. Anterior-like cells also failed to express a large number of prespore-specific characteristics. Although very similar to prestalk cells, anterior-like cells differ from them in that they express a prespore-specific protein PSP59 and the levels of the prestalk-specific mRNA transcripts and one of the prestalk-specific proteins ST430 appear to be lower.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012160685903185</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\IUD85A52\Devine and Loomis - 1985 - Molecular characterization of anterior-like cells .html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-03-03 04:34:23</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoch, J A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regulation of the Phosphorelay and the Initiation of Sporulation in Bacillus Subtilis</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>441-465</pages><volume>47</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev.mi.47.100193.002301</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>Annual Reviews</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.mi.47.100193.002301</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6T8RS9PH\Hoch - 1993 - Regulation of the Phosphorelay and the Initiation .pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2014-02-28 16:22:51</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Appleby, Jeryl L.</author><author>Parkinson, John S.</author><author>Bourret, Robert B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Signal transduction via the multi-step phosphorelay: not necessarily a road less traveled</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title><short-title>Signal transduction via the multi-step phosphorelay</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>845–848</pages><volume>86</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>Google Scholar</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-226770ad-ddea-3a81-a12c-e42208205e48/c/00801580.pdf</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\BEHJ7ANU\Signal Transduction via the Multi-Step PhosphorelayNot Necessarily a Road Less Traveled.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2014-02-28 01:43:35</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hess, J F</author><author>Oosawa, K</author><author>Kaplan, N</author><author>Simon, M I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phosphorylation of three proteins in the signaling pathway of bacterial chemotaxis</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title><abbr-1>Cell</abbr-1></periodical><pages>79-87</pages><volume>53</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Proteins</keyword><keyword>Kinetics</keyword><keyword>Chemotactic Factors</keyword><keyword>Chemotaxis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1988</year><pub-dates><date>Apr 8, 1988</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0092-8674</isbn><abstract>Six cytoplasmic che gene products are required for signal transduction in bacterial chemotaxis, but the nature of their biochemical interactions is not known. We show that in vitro the CheA protein becomes autophosphorylated in the presence of ATP. In addition, the phosphate group on CheA can be rapidly transferred to CheB, a protein involved in adaptation to stimuli, or to CheY, a protein involved in the excitation response. The phosphorylation of CheB and CheY is transient; they readily dephosphorylate. We have also found that CheZ, a protein that appears to antagonize CheY function in vivo, accelerates the hydrolysis of the phosphate on CheY. These results suggest that signal transduction in bacterial chemotaxis may involve the flow of phosphate through a cascade of phosphorylated protein intermediates.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3280143</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Punta, M.</author><author>Coggill, P.

Here we describe the genome of the best-studied member of this group, Dictyostelium discoideum. The gene-dense chromosomes of this organism encode approximately 12,500 predicted proteins, a high proportion of which have long, repetitive amino acid tracts. There are many genes for polyketide synthases and ABC transporters, suggesting an extensive secondary metabolism for producing and exporting small molecules. The genome is rich in complex repeats, one class of which is clustered and may serve as centromeres. Partial copies of the extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA (rDNA) element are found at the ends of each chromosome, suggesting a novel telomere structure and the use of a common mechanism to maintain both the rDNA and chromosomal termini. A proteome-based phylogeny shows that the amoebozoa diverged from the animal–fungal lineage after the plant–animal split, but Dictyostelium seems to have retained more of the diversity of the ancestral genome than have plants, animals or fungi.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7038/full/nature03481.html</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ZKUPKAA6\Eichinger et al. - 2005 - The genome of the social amoeba Dictyostelium disc.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\XN6D6VJT\nature03481.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-02-15 20:08:01</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Crooks, Gavin E.</author><author>Hon, Gary</author><author>Chandonia, John-Marc</author><author>Brenner, Steven E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>WebLogo: a sequence logo generator</title><secondary-title>Genome research</secondary-title><short-title>WebLogo</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome research</full-title></periodical><pages>1188–1190</pages><volume>14</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>Google Scholar</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://genome.cshlp.org/content/14/6/1188.short</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3JNCTZDH\WebLogo.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2014-02-15 19:56:52</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Solomon, J M</author><author>Isberg, R R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Growth of Legionella pneumophila in Dictyostelium discoideum: a novel system for genetic analysis of host-pathogen interactions</title><secondary-title>Trends in microbiology</secondary-title><short-title>Growth of Legionella pneumophila in Dictyostelium discoideum</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Trends Microbiol.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>478-480</pages><volume>8</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dictyostelium</keyword><keyword>Bacteriological Techniques</keyword><keyword>Legionella pneumophila</keyword><keyword>Legionnaires' Disease</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>Oct 2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0966-842X</isbn><abstract>Legionella pneumophila, the Gram-negative bacterium that causes Legionnaires' disease, can be cultured in the laboratory in a variety of fresh-water amoebae and macrophage-like cell lines.

The kinase domain of the osmosensing histidine kinase EnvZ of Escherichia coli consists of two domains: domain A (67 residues) responsible for histidine phosphotransfer and dimerization, and domain B (161 residues) responsible for the catalytic and ATP-binding function. The individual structures of these two domains have been recently solved by NMR spectroscopy. Here, we demonstrate that an enzymatically functional monomeric histidine kinase can be constructed by fusing in tandem two domains A and one domain B to produce a single polypeptide (A–A–B). We show that this protein, EnvZc[AAB], is soluble and exists as a stable monomer. The autophosphorylation and OmpR kinase activities of the monomeric EnvZc[AAB] are similar to that of the wild-type EnvZ, while OmpR-binding and phosphatase functions are reduced. V8 protease digestion and mutational analyses indicate that His-243 of only the amino proximal domain A is phosphorylated. Based on these results, molecular models are proposed for the structures of EnvZc[AAB] and the kinase domain of EnvZ. The present results demonstrate for the first time the construction of a functional, monomeric histidine kinase, further structural studies of which may provide important insights into the structure–function relationships of histidine kinases.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01837.x/abstract</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3VV5NX79\Qin et al. - 2000 - A monomeric histidine kinase derived from EnvZ, an.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\MIPXWJXX\Qin et al. - 2000 - A monomeric histidine kinase derived from EnvZ, an.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-02-14 04:16:19</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bailey, Timothy L.</author><author>Elkan, Charles</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fitting a mixture model by expectation maximization to discover motifs in bipolymers</title></titles><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego</publisher><remote-database-name>Google Scholar</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~brudno/csc2417_10/10.1.1.121.7056.pdf</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\RWWENSUU\Bailey and Elkan - 1994 - Fitting a mixture model by expectation maximizatio.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2014-02-07 05:18:08</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weigt, Martin</author><author>White, Robert A.</author><author>Szurmant, Hendrik</author><author>Hoch, James A.</author><author>Hwa, Terence</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of direct residue contacts in protein–protein interaction by message passing</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>PNAS</abbr-1></periodical><pages>pnas.0805923106</pages><keywords><keyword>signal transduction</keyword><keyword>Two-component system</keyword><keyword>covariance</keyword><keyword>global inference</keyword><keyword>mutual information</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-12-30</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424, 1091-6490</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.0805923106</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in protein–protein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of &gt;2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR) proteins and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein–protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/12/30/0805923106</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\X6AJZZWV\Weigt et al. - 2008 - Identification of direct residue contacts in prote.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19116270</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\MVE7CVP5\Weigt et al. - 2008 - Identification of direct residue contacts in prote.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-02-05 04:57:59</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kenney, Linda J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How important is the phosphatase activity of sensor kinases?</title><secondary-title>Current opinion in microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current opinion in microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Curr.

The majority of HKs (77%) belong to the HisKA subfamily. While both kinase and phosphatase functions have been assayed for HisKA proteins, relatively few examples have been studied to determine which residues are required for kinase and phosphatase activity. Recent studies on NarX, a HisKA_3 family protein, and the dedicated phosphatases CheZ and CheX illustrate requirements for two amino acids for phosphatase function. In this study, we undertook saturating mutagenesis of the proposed interaction surface between the HK and its cognate RR and conclude that only one residue (T/N) is required exclusively for phosphatase activity for HisKA family proteins in evolutionarily distant organisms Myxococcus xanthus and Thermotoga maritima. In addition, we identified only one residue (E/D), adjacent to the conserved site of phosphorylation, required exclusively for kinase activity within the highly conserved motif H-E/D-x-x-T/N. Because similar sequences are found in nearly all HisKA kinases, these residues provide excellent targets for dissection of kinase and phosphatase activities within this broadly occurring family of bacterial kinases.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003084</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2014-02-04 18:14:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Herman, P K</author><author>Rine, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Yeast spore germination: a requirement for Ras protein activity during re-entry into the cell cycle.</title><secondary-title>The EMBO Journal</secondary-title><short-title>Yeast spore germination</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The EMBO Journal</full-title><abbr-1>EMBO J</abbr-1></periodical><pages>6171-6181</pages><volume>16</volume><number>20</number><issue>20</issue><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997-10-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0261-4189</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/emboj/16.20.6171</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Saccharomyces cerevisiae spore germination is a process in which quiescent, non-dividing spores become competent for mitotic cell division. Using a novel assay for spore uncoating, we found that spore germination was a multi-step process whose nutritional requirements differed from those for mitotic division. Although both processes were controlled by nutrient availability, efficient spore germination occurred in conditions that did not support cell division. In addition, germination did not require many key regulators of cell cycle progression including the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc28p. However, two processes essential for cell growth, protein synthesis and signaling through the Ras protein pathway, were required for spore germination. Moreover, increasing Ras protein activity in spores resulted in an accelerated rate of germination and suggested that activation of the Ras pathway was rate-limiting for entry into the germination program. An early step in germination, commitment, was identified as the point at which spores became irreversibly destined to complete the uncoating process even if the original stimulus for germination was removed. Spore commitment to germination required protein synthesis and Ras protein activity; in contrast, post-commitment events did not require ongoing protein synthesis. Altogether, these data suggested a model for Ras function during transitions between periods of quiescence and cell cycle progression.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1326301/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\RK3QFF6U\Herman and Rine - 1997 - Yeast spore germination a requirement for Ras pro.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1326301/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-01-26 22:51:01</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dormann, D</author><author>Vasiev, B</author><author>Weijer, C J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The control of chemotactic cell movement during Dictyostelium morphogenesis.</title><secondary-title>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci</abbr-1></periodical><pages>983-991</pages><volume>355</volume><number>1399</number><issue>1399</issue><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000-7-29</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0962-8436</isbn><abstract>Differential cell movement is an important mechanism in the development and morphogenesis of many organisms. In many cases there are indications that chemotaxis is a key mechanism controlling differential cell movement. This can be particularly well studied in the starvation-induced multicellular development of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Upon starvation, up to 10(5) individual amoebae aggregate to form a fruiting body The cells aggregate by chemotaxis in response to propagating waves of cAMP, initiated by an aggregation centre. During their chemotactic aggregation the cells start to differentiate into prestalk and prespore cells, precursors to the stalk and spores that form the fruiting body. These cells enter the aggregate in a random order but then sort out to form a simple axial pattern in the slug. Our experiments strongly suggest that the multicellular aggregates (mounds) and slugs are also organized by propagating cAMP waves and, furthermore, that cell-type-specific differences in signalling and chemotaxis result in cell sorting, slug formation and movement.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692793/</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692793/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-01-21 05:39:01</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ràfols, Ismael</author><author>Sawada, Yasuji</author><author>Amagai, Aiko</author><author>Maeda, Yasuo</author><author>MacWilliams, Harry K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell type proportioning in Dictyostelium slugs: lack of regulation within a 2.5-fold tolerance range</title><secondary-title>Differentiation</secondary-title><short-title>Cell type proportioning in Dictyostelium slugs</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Differentiation</full-title></periodical><pages>107–116</pages><volume>67</volume><number>4-5</number><issue>4-5</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>Google Scholar</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1432-0436.2001.670403.x/full</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\HUWPEC9I\Cell type proportioning in Dicty slugs.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2014-01-21 05:29:14</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Steinbock, Oliver</author><author>Siegert, Florian</author><author>Müller, Stefan C.</author><author>Weijer, Cornelis J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Three-dimensional waves of excitation during Dictyostelium morphogenesis</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>7332–7335</pages><volume>90</volume><number>15</number><issue>15</issue><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>Google Scholar</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/90/15/7332.short</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\FSUESAKQ\Three dimensional waves of excitation during Dictyostelium morphogenesis.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2014-01-21 05:19:39</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harris, Tony J.

However, it is unclear how phospholipid-anchored adhesion molecules, such as the Dictyostelium receptor gp80, interact with the cytoskeleton. gp80 has been found to form adhesion complexes from raftlike membrane domains, which can be isolated as a Triton X-100-insoluble floating fraction (TIFF). We report here that the actin-binding protein ponticulin mediates TIFF-cytoskeleton interactions. Analysis of gp80-null cells revealed that these interactions were minimal in the absence of gp80. During development, gp80 was required to enhance these interactions as its adhesion complexes assembled. Whereas ponticulin and gp80 could partition independently into TIFF, gp80 was shown to recruit ponticulin to cell-cell contacts and to increase its partitioning into TIFF. However, these proteins did not co-immunoprecipitate. Furthermore, sterol sequestration abrogated the association of ponticulin with TIFF without affecting gp80, suggesting that sterols may mediate the interactions between ponticulin and gp80. In ponticulin-null cells, large gp80 adhesion complexes assembled in the absence of ponticulin despite the lack of cytoskeleton association. We propose that such nascent gp80 adhesion complexes produce expanded raftlike domains that recruit ponticulin and thereby establish stable cytoskeleton interactions to complete the assembly process.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.jbc.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jbc.org/content/278/4/2614</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\4BPJRNC7\Harris et al. - 2003 - Cytoskeleton Interactions Involved in the Assembly.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12421828</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\UDGHRP7T\2614.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-01-21 05:02:18</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chisholm, Rex L.</author><author>Firtel, Richard A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Insights into morphogenesis from a simple developmental system</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>531-541</pages><volume>5</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>July 2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-0072</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrm1427</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We are only starting to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie cell and tissue movements during morphogenesis in metazoans.

Under conditions known to inhibit the production of extracellular inhibitor or in mutants that lack it, extracellular phosphodiesterase activity was already high and could not be increased by dithiothreitol.

Here we show by live-cell imaging of intact cell populations that pulses originate from a discrete location despite constant exchange of cells to and from the region. In a perfusion chamber, both isolated single cells and cell populations switch from quiescence to rhythmic activity depending on the level of extracellular cAMP.

It is shown that the directional sensing of amoebae is due to the sensitivity of the cells to the time variation of the concentration of the chemoattractant combined with its spatial gradient. It is also shown that chemotaxis exclusively driven by local concentration gradient leads to unstable local motion, preventing cells from aggregation. These findings show that the formation of mounds, which initiate multicellularity in Dictyostelium discoideum, is caused by the sensitivity of the amoebae due to three factors, namely, to the direction of propagation of the chemoattractant, to its spatial gradient, and to the emergence of cAMP “emitting centres”, responsible for the local accumulation of the amoebae.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631069113002035</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\XC8JIPUK\Dilão and Hauser - 2013 - Chemotaxis with directional sensing during Dictyos.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\JVAI6NCT\Dilão and Hauser - 2013 - Chemotaxis with directional sensing during Dictyos.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-01-21 00:05:39</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wheate, Nial J</author><author>Walker, Shonagh</author><author>Craig, Gemma E</author><author>Oun, Rabbab</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The status of platinum anticancer drugs in the clinic and in clinical trials</title><secondary-title>Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England: 2003)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England: 2003)</full-title><abbr-1>Dalton Trans</abbr-1></periodical><pages>8113-8127</pages><volume>39</volume><number>35</number><issue>35</issue><keywords><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents</keyword><keyword>Clinical Trials as Topic</keyword><keyword>Coordination Complexes</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Platinum</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>Sep 21, 2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1477-9234</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/c0dt00292e</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Since its approval in 1979 cisplatin has become an important component in chemotherapy regimes for the treatment of ovarian, testicular, lung and bladder cancers, as well as lymphomas, myelomas and melanoma. Unfortunately its continued use is greatly limited by severe dose limiting side effects and intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. Over the last 30 years, 23 other platinum-based drugs have entered clinical trials with only two (carboplatin and oxaliplatin) of these gaining international marketing approval, and another three (nedaplatin, lobaplatin and heptaplatin) gaining approval in individual nations. During this time there have been more failures than successes with the development of 14 drugs being halted during clinical trials. Currently there are four drugs in the various phases of clinical trial (satraplatin, picoplatin, Lipoplatin and ProLindac). No new small molecule platinum drug has entered clinical trials since 1999 which is representative of a shift in focus away from drug design and towards drug delivery in the last decade. In this perspective article we update the status of platinum anticancer drugs currently approved for use, those undergoing clinical trials and those discontinued during clinical trials, and discuss the results in the context of where we believe the field will develop over the next decade.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20593091</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, G</author><author>Alexander, H</author><author>Schneider, N</author><author>Alexander, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular basis for resistance to the anticancer drug cisplatin in Dictyostelium</title><secondary-title>Microbiology (Reading, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microbiology (Reading, England)</full-title><abbr-1>Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2219-2227</pages><volume>146 ( Pt 9)</volume><keywords><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis, Insertional</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Dictyostelium</keyword><keyword>Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents</keyword><keyword>Aldehyde-Lyases</keyword><keyword>Cisplatin</keyword><keyword>Drug Resistance</keyword><keyword>Receptors, Purinergic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>Sep 2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1350-0872</isbn><abstract>The efficacy of the widely used chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin is limited by the occurrence of drug-resistant tumour cells. To fully exploit the potential of this drug in cancer therapy, it is imperative to understand the molecular basis of cisplatin resistance. Using an insertional mutagenesis technique in cells of Dictyostelium discoideum, we have identified six genes which are involved in cisplatin resistance. None of these genes has been previously linked to resistance to this drug. Several of these genes encode proteins that are involved in signal transduction pathways which regulate cell death, cell proliferation or gene regulation. The resistance of these mutant strains is specific for cisplatin, since deletion of these genes does not confer resistance to other DNA-damaging agents. Significantly, the disruption of three of these genes, encoding the sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase, the RegA cAMP phosphodiesterase and a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, also results in abnormalities in the multicellular development of this organism, although there is no change in the rate of mitotic cell growth. This study has identified previously unsuspected molecular pathways which function in the cellular response to cisplatin and are required for normal morphogenesis, and underscores the complexity of the cellular response to cisplatin. These pathways provide potential targets for modulating the response to this important drug.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI

Under those conditions, the tripartite sensor kinase ArcB undergoes autophosphorylation at the expense of ATP and subsequently transphosphorylates its cognate response regulator ArcA through a His → Asp → His → Asp phosphorelay pathway. In this study we used various combinations of wild-type and mutant ArcB domains to analyze in vitro the pathway for signal decay. The results indicate that ArcA-P dephosphorylation does not occur by direct hydrolysis but by transfer of the phosphoryl group to the secondary transmitter and subsequently to the receiver domain of ArcB. This reverse phosphorelay involves both the conserved His-717 of the secondary transmitter domain and the conserved Asp-576 of the receiver domain of ArcB but not the conserved His-292 of its primary transmitter domain. This novel pathway for signal decay may generally apply to signal transduction systems with tripartite sensor kinases.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.jbc.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jbc.org/content/273/49/32864</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\D67GZD9X\Georgellis et al. - 1998 - Signal Decay through a Reverse Phosphorelay in the.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9830034</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\U4A66QGP\Georgellis et al. - 1998 - Signal Decay through a Reverse Phosphorelay in the.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-01-20 19:30:33</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, D</author><author>Forst, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic analysis of the histidine kinase family in bacteria and archaea</title><secondary-title>Microbiology (Reading, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microbiology (Reading, England)</full-title><abbr-1>Microbiology (Reading, Engl.)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1197-1212</pages><volume>147</volume><number>Pt 5</number><issue>Pt 5</issue><keywords><keyword>Bacteria</keyword><keyword>Protein Kinases</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Protein Structure, Tertiary</keyword><keyword>Sequence Analysis, DNA</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Sequence Homology, Amino Acid</keyword><keyword>Evolution, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Archaea</keyword><keyword>Conserved Sequence</keyword><keyword>Genome, Archaeal</keyword><keyword>Genome, Bacterial</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>May 2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1350-0872</isbn><abstract>Two-component signal transduction systems, consisting of histidine kinase (HK) sensors and DNA-binding response regulators, allow bacteria and archaea to respond to diverse environmental stimuli. HKs possess a conserved domain (H-box region) which contains the site of phosphorylation and an ATP-binding kinase domain. In this study, a genomic approach was taken to analyse the HK family in bacteria and archaea. Based on phylogenetic analysis, differences in the sequence and organization of the H-box and kinase domains, and the predicted secondary structure of the H-box region, five major HK types were identified. Of the 336 HKs analysed, 92% could be assigned to one of the five major HK types. The Type I HKs were found predominantly in bacteria while Type II HKs were not prevalent in bacteria but constituted the major type (13 of 15 HKs) in the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Type III HKs were generally more prevalent in Gram-positive bacteria and were the major HK type (14 of 15 HKs) in the archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. Type IV HKs represented a minor type found in bacteria. The fifth HK type was composed of the chemosensor HKs, CheA. Several bacterial genomes contained all five HK types. In contrast, archaeal genomes either contained a specific HK type or lacked HKs altogether. These findings suggest that the different HK types originated in bacteria and that specific HK types were acquired in archaea by horizontal gene transfer.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11320123</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klein, Adam H</author><author>Shulla, Ana</author><author>Reimann, Sylvia A</author><author>Keating, David H</author><author>Wolfe, Alan J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The intracellular concentration of acetyl phosphate in Escherichia coli is sufficient for direct phosphorylation of two-component response regulators</title><secondary-title>Journal of bacteriology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of bacteriology</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Although acetyl phosphate clearly signals through two-component response regulators, it remains unclear whether acetyl phosphate acts as a direct phospho donor or functions through an indirect mechanism. We used two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography to measure the relative concentrations of acetyl phosphate, acetyl coenzyme A, ATP, and GTP over the course of the entire growth curve.

The activity of all response regulators is modulated by phosphorylation of the conserved N-terminal receiver domain. Phosphorylation of the dimeric NtrC has two consequences: (i) a strong increase in the cooperative binding of NtrC to two adjacent binding sites and (ii) activation of NtrC as an ATPase. Here we show that phosphorylation of NtrC is not sufficient for activation of NtrC. At low protein concentrations (50 nM), phosphorylated NtrC was only active as an ATPase upon cooperative binding to DNA. At high protein concentrations (above 50 nM), NtrC was active in the absence of DNA, and activation occurred in parallel with the formation of high-molecular-weight aggregates. We infer that activation of NtrC involves an interaction between two NtrC-P dimers and proceeds in two steps. The first step is the phosphorylation of NtrC. The second step is the interaction between two NtrC-P dimers. This interaction induces the conformational change in NtrC-P to the active conformation.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC177284/</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC177284/pdf/1775056.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC177284/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-01-17 04:44:26</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, T</author><author>Inouye, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ligand binding to the receptor domain regulates the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activities of the signaling domain of the hybrid Escherichia coli transmembrane receptor, Taz1</title><secondary-title>Journal of molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of molecular biology</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Taz1 is able to induce ompC-lacZ expression in response to aspartate added to the medium. We introduced amino acid substitution mutations in the highly conserved region of the signaling domain of Tar near the Tar-EnvZ junction. The same mutations in Tsr, a serine chemoreceptor, are known to lock the flagella rotation in either a clockwise (CW) or in a counter-clockwise (CCW) mode. It was found that a CW-biased mutation in Taz1 resulted in ompC-lacZ expression in the "off mode", or low ompC-lacZ expression in both the absence and presence of aspartate, while CCW-biased mutations caused ompC-lacZ expression in the "on mode", or constitutive expression regardless of aspartate. The OmpR kinase and phospho-OmpR phosphatase activities of the wild-type and mutant Taz proteins were also examined in response to aspartate. The phosphatase activity of the wild-type Taz1 was found to decrease in the presence of aspartate, while the OmpR kinase activity remained constant. This indicated that aspartate binding to the Taz1 receptor domain modulates the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity of the signaling domain. An increased kinase to phosphatase ratio in the presence of aspartate resulted in higher levels of phospho-OmpR in the cell and therefore induced ompC-lacZ expression. In contrast to the wild-type Taz1 protein, the enzymatic activities of CW as well as CCW mutants did not change in response to aspartate, indicating that mutant Taz proteins are incapable of transducing the signal across the membrane as a result of a locked conformation of the signaling domain in either the on or off mode.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8393937</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, Phoebe R.</author><author>Ecker, Joseph R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>THE ETHYLENE GAS SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAY: A Molecular Perspective</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Genetics</secondary-title><short-title>THE ETHYLENE GAS SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAY</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>227-254</pages><volume>32</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev.genet.32.1.227</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The gaseous hormone ethylene induces diverse effects in plants throughout their life cycle. Ethylene response is regulated at multiple levels, from hormone synthesis and perception to signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. As more genes in the ethylene response pathway are cloned and characterized, they illustrate the precision with which signaling can be controlled. Wounding, pathogenic attack, flooding, fruit ripening, development, senescence, and ethylene treatment itself induce ethylene production. Ethylene binding to receptors with homology to two-component regulators triggers a kinase cascade that is propagated through the CTR1 Raf-like kinase and other components to the nucleus. Activation of the EIN3 family of nuclear proteins leads to induction of the relevant ethyleneresponsive genes via other transcription factors, eliciting a response appropriate to the original stimulus.</abstract><remote-database-name>Annual Reviews</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.genet.32.1.227</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\FN29QD9E\Johnson and Ecker - 1998 - THE ETHYLENE GAS SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAY A Mo.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2014-01-15 21:14:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brown, Jason M</author><author>Firtel, Richard A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phosphorelay signalling: New tricks for an ancient pathway</title><secondary-title>Current Biology</secondary-title><short-title>Phosphorelay signalling</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Current Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>R662-R665</pages><volume>8</volume><number>18</number><issue>18</issue><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>September 10, 1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0960-9822</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0960-9822(07)00417-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>‘Two-component’ phosphorelay systems, once thought to be used exclusively by prokaryotes, have in the past few years been shown to exist in eukaryotes.

We isolated previously multicopy suppressors which can complement a defect in the phosphotransfer signal transduction caused by an envZ deletion mutation. Among such suppressors, arcB and barA are of particular interest because these gene products are unique in the sense that they contain both an autophosphorylated histidine site (or transmitter module) and a phospho-accepting aspartate site (or receiver module) in their primary amino acid sequences. Here we report that ArcB and BarA possess in the C-terminal region a phosphorylated histidine site which has never been noticed, in addition to the authentic one identified previously. This newly identified histidine in ArcB and BarA was demonstrated to play a crucial role in the observed multicopy suppression. Furthermore, it was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro for ArcB that the C-terminal domain containing the histidine can function as an alternative phosphodonor (or transmitter). This novel type of sensory kinase was therefore revealed to contain two independent phosphodonor sites, together with a phospho-accepting site. These findings suggest that this unique feature of ArcB and BarA, in terms of the signaling modules, make it possible for these sensory kinases to function as dual-signaling transducers.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC395468/</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC395468/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2014-01-11 18:13:42</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><titles/><dates/><urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\Q6MXW8CH\Invitrogen TOPO TA Cloning Kit.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singleton, C K</author><author>Zinda, M J</author><author>Mykytka, B</author><author>Yang, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The histidine kinase dhkC regulates the choice between migrating slugs and terminal differentiation in Dictyostelium discoideum</title><secondary-title>Developmental biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Developmental biology</full-title><abbr-1>Dev.

The choice between these alternative morphological pathways is influenced by external and internal cues. dhkC was identified as a potential hybrid sensor kinase possessing domains homologous to the histidine kinase and receiver motifs of two-component signaling systems. Null strains of dhkC show a rapidly developing phenotype for aggregation through finger formation, and culmination commences immediately thereafter and proceeds at a normal rate to generate typical fruiting bodies. Ammonia, an endogenous regulator of the slug versus culmination choice, results in a prolonged slug stage for wild-type strains while the dhkC- strain bypasses the slug stage in the presence or absence of ammonia. Conversely, expression in wild-type cells of a modified DHKC protein composed of only the histidine kinase domain results in normal timing through early aggregation, but subsequent development is significantly delayed. The resulting fingers, once formed, readily convert to slugs that do not undergo culmination but instead migrate until their energy sources are depleted. The slugger phenotype is dependent on the presence of a functional response regulator REGA, and it is rescued by exogenously supplied cAMP. Together, the results indicate that DHKC contributes to the integration of environmental and cellular signals so that the appropriate choice is made between slug formation and culmination. We suggest that DHKC may function as a sensor for ammonia, and that it is the initial component of a phosphorelay signaling system that may modulate the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase to either inhibit or promote culmination. Additionally, dhkC- spores were found to be defective in germination, indicating a role for the DHKC signaling pathway in activating spore germination.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9808785</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Inouye, Masayori</author><author>Dutta, Rinku</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Histidine Kinases in Signal Transduction</title></titles><pages>540</pages><keywords><keyword>Medical / Pharmacology</keyword><keyword>Science / Life Sciences / Biochemistry</keyword><keyword>Science / Life Sciences / Biophysics</keyword><keyword>Science / Life Sciences / Cell Biology</keyword><keyword>Science / Life Sciences / Microbiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002-11-13</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Academic Press</publisher><isbn>978-0-08-053401-5</isbn><abstract>Living cells are constantly sensing environmental changes, and their abilities to sense these changes and adapt to them are essential for their survival.

Pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug, after intravenous and oral application, were studied in solid tumors and clinical Phase I - III trials performed, in particular in NSCLC and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Results showed low clinical activity of picoplatin.&#xD;AREAS COVERED: This article presents an overview of the pharmacokinetic assessments of picoplatin in lung cancer. Specifically, the authors address the relationship between disposition and clinical activity of the drug.&#xD;EXPERT OPINION: Picoplatin failed to overcome resistance to platinum compounds in lung cancer to achieve significant improved survival of most patients. Even highest doses of the drug reaching 150 m/m² given intravenously every 3 weeks were not sufficient to achieve better response than existing chemotherapeutics and the oral bioavailability of a dose of 200 - 400 mg corresponded only to 80 mg/m² iv. Picoplatin therefore seem to be quite ineffective. Picoplatin is expected to overcome tumor resistance in cases which overexpress thiol-conjugating pathways; however, this was not proved in clinical trials. To conclude, this blocked platinum complex is not able to reverse cisplatin resistance to a significant extent in vivo and its mechanisms and kinetics and of DNA damage failed to produce significant clinical results compared to second-line standard therapy for lung cancer.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23829480</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nowotnik, David P</author><author>Cvitkovic, Esteban</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ProLindac™ (AP5346): A review of the development of an HPMA DACH platinum Polymer Therapeutic</title><secondary-title>Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews</secondary-title><short-title>ProLindac™ (AP5346)</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews</full-title><abbr-1>Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1214-1219</pages><volume>61</volume><number>13</number><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>HPMA</keyword><keyword>Oxaliplatin</keyword><keyword>ProLindac</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>November 12, 2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0169-409X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.addr.2009.06.004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>ProLindac™ (AP5346) is DACH (diaminocyclohexane) platinum polymer prodrug currently in phase II clinical development. It uses a 25 kDa polymer delivery vehicle based on hydroxypropylmethacrylamide (HPMA) to target the active form of the approved drug oxaliplatin to tumors. The pH-sensitive linker that binds platinum to the polymer releases platinum more rapidly in low pH environments, as found typically in many tumors. This review summarizes the development of ProLindac to date, including preclinical efficacy studies, the phase I monotherapy clinical study in patients with solid tumors, and the phase I/II monotherapy study in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Both preclinical and clinical study data indicate that ProLindac exhibits efficacy at least equal to, and likely superior to oxaliplatin, while demonstrating excellent tolerability.

Despite many progresses being made in the identification of protein coding regions by computational methods during the last two decades, the performances and efficiencies of the prediction methods still need to be improved. In addition, it is indispensable to develop different prediction methods since combining different methods may greatly improve the prediction accuracy. A new method to predict protein coding regions is developed in this paper based on the fact that most of exon sequences have a 3-base periodicity, while intron sequences do not have this unique feature. The method computes the 3-base periodicity and the background noise of the stepwise DNA segments of the target DNA sequences using nucleotide distributions in the three codon positions of the DNA sequences. Exon and intron sequences can be identified from trends of the ratio of the 3-base periodicity to the background noise in the DNA sequences. Case studies on genes from different organisms show that this method is an effective approach for exon prediction.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.amherst.edu/science/article/pii/S0022519307001543</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tiwari, S</author><author>Ramachandran, S</author><author>Bhattacharya, A</author><author>Bhattacharya, S</author><author>Ramaswamy, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction of probable genes by Fourier analysis of genomic sequences</title><secondary-title>Computer applications in the biosciences: CABIOS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer applications in the biosciences: CABIOS</full-title><abbr-1>Comput.

Our aim is to use Fourier techniques to analyse this periodicity, and thereby to develop a tool to recognize coding regions in genomic DNA.&#xD;RESULT: The three-base periodicity in the nucleotide arrangement is evidenced as a sharp peak at frequency f = 1/3 in the Fourier (or power) spectrum. From extensive spectral analysis of DNA sequences of total length over 5.5 million base pairs from a wide variety or organisms (including the human genome), and by separately examining coding and non-coding sequences, we find that the relative-height of the peak at f = 1/3 in the Fourier spectrum is a good discriminator of coding potential. This feature is utilized by us to detect probable coding regions in DNA sequences, by examining the local signal-to-noise ratio of the peak within a sliding window. While the overall accuracy is comparable to that of other techniques currently in use, the measure that is presently proposed is independent of training sets or existing database information, and can thus find general application.&#xD;AVAILABILITY: A computer program GeneScan which locates coding open reading frames and exonic regions in genomic sequences has been developed, and is available on request.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9183531</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anwar, Adil</author><author>Dehn, Donna</author><author>Siegel, David</author><author>Kepa, Jadwiga K</author><author>Tang, Luo Jia</author><author>Pietenpol, Jennifer A</author><author>Ross, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interaction of human NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) with the tumor suppressor protein p53 in cells and cell-free systems</title><secondary-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</secondary-title><short-title>Interaction of human NAD(P)H</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of biological chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>J.

We report that treatment of HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells with the NQO1 inhibitor ES936 had no effect on the levels of p53 protein. ES936 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of NQO1 that irreversibly blocks the catalytic function of the enzyme. This suggests that a redox mechanism involving NQO1-mediated NAD(P)H oxidation is not responsible for the stabilization of p53. We also examined the ability of the NQO1 protein to associate with p53 using co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Results from these experiments demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation of NQO1 with p53 and vice versa. The association between p53 and NQO1 was not affected by treatment of HCT-116 cells with ES936, demonstrating that the association was not dependent on the catalytic activity of NQO1. A comparison of isogenic HCT-116 p53+/+ and HCT-116 p53-/- cells demonstrated an interaction of NQO1 and p53 only in the p53+/+ cells. Experiments performed in an in vitro transcription/translation system utilizing rabbit reticulocyte lysates confirmed the interaction of NQO1 and p53. In these experiments a full-length p53 coding region was used to express p53 in the presence of recombinant NQO1 protein. An association of p53 and NQO1 was also observed in primary human keratinocytes and mammary epithelial cells. In studies where mdm-2 co-immunoprecipitated with p53, no association of mdm-2 with NQO1 was observed. These data demonstrate an association between p53 and NQO1 that may represent an alternate mechanism of p53 stabilization by NQO1 in a wide variety of human cell types.</abstract><remote-database-name>NCBI PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12529318</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vousden, Karen H.</author><author>Ryan, Kevin M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>p53 and metabolism</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Cancer</full-title><abbr-1>Nat Rev Cancer</abbr-1></periodical><pages>691-700</pages><volume>9</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>October 2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1474-175X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrc2715</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although metabolic alterations have been observed in cancer for almost a century, only recently have the mechanisms underlying these changes been identified and the importance of metabolic transformation realized. p53 has been shown to respond to metabolic changes and to influence metabolic pathways through several mechanisms.

In the absence of p53, B56γ-PP2A can inhibit cell proliferation and cell transformation by an unknown mechanism. In the presence of p53, upon DNA damage, a complex including B56γ-PP2A and p53 is formed which leads to Thr55 dephosphorylation of p53, induction of the p53 transcriptional target p21, and inhibition of cell proliferation. Despite its significance in inhibition of cell proliferation, no B56γ mutations have been linked to human cancer to date. In this study, we first differentiate between the p53-dependent and -independent functions of B56γ-PP2A by identifying a domain of the B56γ protein required for interaction with p53. Within this region we identify a B56γ mutation, F395C, in lung cancer that disrupts the B56γ-p53 interaction. More importantly, we show that F395C is unable to promote p53 Thr55 dephosphorylation, transcriptional activation of p21, and the p53-dependent tumor suppressive function of PP2A. This finding provides a mechanistic basis for the p53-dependent and -independent functions of B56γ-PP2A and establishes a critical link between B56γ-PP2A p53-dependent tumor suppressive function and tumorigenesis.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2900437/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\9EW852VI\Shouse et al. - 2010 - A B56 mutation in lung cancer disrupts the p53-de.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2900437/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2013-11-03 05:27:49</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Asher, Gad</author><author>Lotem, Joseph</author><author>Cohen, Batya</author><author>Sachs, Leo</author><author>Shaul, Yosef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regulation of p53 stability and p53-dependent apoptosis  by NADH quinone oxidoreductase 1</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1188-1193</pages><volume>98</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001-1-30</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424</isbn><abstract>The tumor suppressor gene wild-type p53 encodes a&#xD; labile protein that accumulates in cells after different stress signals&#xD; and can cause either growth arrest or apoptosis. One of the p53&#xD; target genes, p53-inducible gene 3 (PIG3), encodes a&#xD; protein with significant homology to oxidoreductases, enzymes involved&#xD; in cellular responses to oxidative stress and irradiation. This fact&#xD; raised the possibility that cellular oxidation–reduction events&#xD; controlled by such enzymes also may regulate the level of p53. Here we&#xD; show that NADH quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) regulates p53 stability.&#xD; The NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol caused a reduction in the level of&#xD; both endogenous and γ-irradiation-induced p53 in HCT116&#xD; human colon carcinoma cells. This reduction was prevented by the&#xD; proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin, suggesting enhanced p53&#xD; degradation in the presence of dicoumarol. Dicoumarol-induced&#xD; degradation of p53 also was prevented in the presence of simian virus&#xD; 40 large T antigen, which is known to bind and to stabilize p53. Cells&#xD; overexpressing NQO1 were resistant to dicoumarol, and this finding&#xD; indicates the direct involvement of NQO1 in p53 stabilization. NQO1&#xD; inhibition induced p53 degradation and blocked wild-type p53-mediated&#xD; apoptosis in γ-irradiated normal thymocytes and in M1 myeloid&#xD; leukemic cells that overexpress wild-type p53.&#xD; Dicoumarol also reduced the level of p53 in its mutant form in M1&#xD; cells.

Whole genome amplification (WGA) is the first step for single-cell sequencing, but its throughput and accuracy are insufficient in conventional reaction platforms. Here, we introduce single droplet multiple displacement amplification (sd-MDA), a method that enables massively parallel amplification of single cell genomes while maintaining sequence accuracy and specificity. Tens of thousands of single cells are compartmentalized in millions of picoliter droplets and then subjected to lysis and WGA by passive droplet fusion in microfluidic channels. Because single cells are isolated in compartments, their genomes are amplified to saturation without contamination. This enables the high-throughput acquisition of contamination-free and cell specific sequence reads from single cells (21,000 single-cells/h), resulting in enhancement of the sequence data quality compared to conventional methods. This method allowed WGA of both single bacterial cells and human cancer cells. The obtained sequencing coverage rivals those of conventional techniques with superior sequence quality. In addition, we also demonstrate de novo assembly of uncultured soil bacteria and obtain draft genomes from single cell sequencing. This sd-MDA is promising for flexible and scalable use in single-cell sequencing.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05436-4</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05436-4.pdf</url><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05436-4#Sec10</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-03 22:11:12</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weibel, Douglas B.</author><author>DiLuzio, Willow R.</author><author>Whitesides, George M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Microfabrication meets microbiology</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>209-218</pages><volume>5</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1740-1534</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrmicro1616</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This Review summarizes methods for constructing systems and structures at micron or submicron scales that have applications in microbiology.

However, it remains unclear whether adaptive mutations fix in the population or lead to pathogen diversification within the patient,. Here, we study the genotypic diversity of Burkholderia dolosa within people with cystic fibrosis by re-sequencing individual colonies and whole populations from single sputum samples. Extensive intra-sample diversity reveals that mutations rarely fix within a patient's pathogen population—instead, diversifying lineages coexist for many years. When strong selection is acting on a gene, multiple adaptive mutations arise but neither sweeps to fixation, generating lasting allele diversity that provides a recorded signature of past selection. Genes involved in outer-membrane components, iron scavenging and antibiotic resistance all showed this signature of within-patient selection.

The degree of compaction results from the level of DNA-supercoiling and the presence of nucleoid-binding proteins. DNA-supercoiling is homeostatically maintained by the opposing activities of relaxing DNA topoisomerases and negative supercoil-inducing DNA gyrase. DNA-supercoiling acts as a general cis regulator of transcription, which can be superimposed upon other types of more specific trans regulatory mechanism. Transcriptomic studies on the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, which has a relatively small genome (~2 Mb) and few nucleoid-binding proteins, have been performed under conditions of local and global changes in supercoiling. The response to local changes induced by fluoroquinolone antibiotics, which target DNA gyrase subunit A and/or topoisomerase IV, involves an increase in oxygen radicals which reduces cell viability, while the induction of global supercoiling changes by novobiocin (a DNA gyrase subunit B inhibitor), or by seconeolitsine (a topoisomerase I inhibitor), has revealed the existence of topological domains that specifically respond to such changes. The control of DNA-supercoiling in S. pneumoniae occurs mainly via the regulation of topoisomerase gene transcription: relaxation triggers the up-regulation of gyrase and the down-regulation of topoisomerases I and IV, while hypernegative supercoiling down-regulates the expression of topoisomerase I. Relaxation affects 13% of the genome, with the majority of the genes affected located in 15 domains. Hypernegative supercoiling affects 10% of the genome, with one quarter of the genes affected located in 12 domains. However, all the above domains overlap, suggesting that the chromosome is organized into topological domains with fixed locations. Based on its response to relaxation, the pneumococcal chromosome can be said to be organized into five types of domain: up-regulated, down-regulated, position-conserved non-regulated, position-variable non-regulated, and AT-rich. The AT content is higher in the up-regulated than in the down-regulated domains. Genes within the different domains share structural and functional characteristics. It would seem that a topology-driven selection pressure has defined the chromosomal location of the metabolism, virulence and competence genes, which suggests the existence of topological rules that aim to improve bacterial fitness.</abstract><remote-database-name>Frontiers</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01447/full</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2018-01-10 16:07:06</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sanchez, Guillermo V.</author><author>Master, Ronald N.</author><author>Karlowsky, James A.</author><author>Bordon, Jose M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In Vitro Antimicrobial Resistance of Urinary Escherichia coli Isolates among U.S. Outpatients from 2000 to 2010</title><secondary-title>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</full-title><abbr-1>Antimicrob.

Here we review the epidemiology, virulence mechanisms, and host response to the most frequently isolated Gram-positive uropathogens: Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. We also review several emerging, rare, misclassified, and otherwise underreported Gram-positive pathogens of the urinary tract including Aerococcus, Corynebacterium, Actinobaculum, and Gardnerella. The literature strongly suggests that urologic diseases involving Gram-positive bacteria may be easily overlooked due to limited culture-based assays typically utilized for urine in hospital microbiology laboratories. Some UTIs are polymicrobial in nature, often involving one or more Gram-positive bacteria. We herein review the risk factors and recent evidence for mechanisms of bacterial synergy in experimental models of polymicrobial UTI. Recent experimental data has demonstrated that, despite being cleared quickly from the bladder, some Gram-positive bacteria can impact pathogenic outcomes of co-infecting organisms. When taken together, the available evidence argues that Gram-positive bacteria are important uropathogens in their own right, but that some can be easily overlooked because they are missed by routine diagnostic methods. Finally, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that a surprising variety of fastidious Gram-positive bacteria may either reside in or be regularly exposed to the urinary tract and further suggests that their presence is widespread among women, as well as men. Experimental studies in this area are needed; however, there is a growing appreciation that the composition of bacteria found in the bladder could be a potentially important determinant in urologic disease, including susceptibility to UTI.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4888879/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PJ5NJSVS\Kline and Lewis - 2016 - Gram-Positive Uropathogens, Polymicrobial Urinary .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4888879/</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stamm, Walter E.</author><author>Norrby, S.

A core problem is that there is no sufficiently fast diagnostic test to guide correct antibiotic prescription at the point of care. Here, we investigate if it is possible to develop a point-of-care susceptibility test for urinary tract infection, a disease that 100 million women suffer from annually and that exhibits widespread antibiotic resistance. We capture bacterial cells directly from samples with low bacterial counts (104 cfu/mL) using a custom-designed microfluidic chip and monitor their individual growth rates using microscopy. By averaging the growth rate response to an antibiotic over many individual cells, we can push the detection time to the biological response time of the bacteria. We find that it is possible to detect changes in growth rate in response to each of nine antibiotics that are used to treat urinary tract infections in minutes. In a test of 49 clinical uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) isolates, all were correctly classified as susceptible or resistant to ciprofloxacin in less than 10 min. The total time for antibiotic susceptibility testing, from loading of sample to diagnostic readout, is less than 30 min, which allows the development of a point-of-care test that can guide correct treatment of urinary tract infection.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/114/34/9170</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\K8EK4F43\Baltekin et al. - 2017 - Antibiotic susceptibility testing in less than 30 .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28790187</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\2BA22P26\9170.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-01-10 00:01:06</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hyland, Kendra A.</author><author>Brennan, Robert</author><author>Olmsted, Stephen B.</author><author>Rojas, Eduardo</author><author>Murphy, Ellen</author><author>Wang, Beinan</author><author>Cleary, P.

Streptococcus pyogenes can persist in tonsils, and one-third of children treated with antibiotics continue to shed streptococci and have recurrent infections. Mouse nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) is functionally analogous to human oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues, and serves as a model for characterization of the mucosal innate immune response to S. pyogenes. Wild-type S. pyogenes induces transcription of both type I and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-responsive genes, proinflammatory genes and acute-phase response proteins 24 h after intranasal infection. Invasion of NALT and the induction of the interferon response were not dependent on expression of antiphagocytic M protein. Intranasal infection induces a substantial influx of neutrophils into NALT at 24 h, which declines by 48 h after infection. Infection of IFN-gamma(-/-) [IFN-gamma knock-out mouse (GKO)] C57BL/6 mice with wild-type S. pyogenes resulted in local dissemination of bacteria to draining lymph nodes (LN), but did not lead to systemic infection by 48 h after infection. Infected GKO mice had an increased influx of neutrophils into NALT compared with immunocompetent mice. Thus, IFN-gamma-induced responses are required to prevent local dissemination of streptococci to the draining LN.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19243434</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jensen, Paul A.</author><author>Zhu, Zeyu</author><author>van Opijnen, Tim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antibiotics Disrupt Coordination between Transcriptional and Phenotypic Stress Responses in Pathogenic Bacteria</title><secondary-title>Cell Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Reports</full-title><abbr-1>Cell Rep</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1705-1716</pages><volume>20</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>data integration</keyword><keyword>metabolic modeling</keyword><keyword>Pseudomonas</keyword><keyword>RNA-seq</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus</keyword><keyword>stress response</keyword><keyword>systems biology</keyword><keyword>Tn-seq</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>Aug 15, 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2211-1247</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.celrep.2017.07.062</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Bacterial genes that change in expression upon environmental disturbance have commonly been seen as those that must also phenotypically matter. However, several studies suggest that differentially expressed genes are rarely phenotypically important. We demonstrate, for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that these seemingly uncoordinated gene sets are involved in responses that can be linked through topological network analysis. However, the level of coordination is stress dependent. While a well-coordinated response is triggered in response to nutrient stress, antibiotics trigger an uncoordinated response in which transcriptionally and phenotypically important genes are neither linked spatially nor in their magnitude. Moreover, a gene expression meta-analysis reveals that genes with large fitness changes during stress have low transcriptional variation across hundreds of other conditions, and vice versa. Our work suggests that cellular responses can be understood through network models that incorporate regulatory and genetic relationships, which could aid drug target predictions and genetic network engineering.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28813680</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mobegi, Fredrick M.</author><author>Zomer, Aldert</author><author>Jonge, De</author><author>I, Marien</author><author>Hijum, Van</author><author>T, Sacha A.

Knowledge of essential genes gives insight into the core structure and functioning of a cell. This might lead to more efficient antimicrobial drug discovery, to elucidation of the correlations between genotype and phenotype, and a better understanding of the minimal requirements for a (synthetic) cell. Traditionally, constructing a catalog of essential genes for a given microbe involved costly and time-consuming laboratory experiments. While experimental methods have produced abundant gene essentiality data for model organisms like Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, the knowledge generated cannot automatically be extrapolated to predict essential genes in all bacteria. In addition, essential genes identified in the laboratory are by definition ‘conditionally essential', as they are essential under the specified experimental conditions: these might not resemble conditions in the microorganisms’ natural habitat(s). Also, large-scale experimental assaying for essential genes is not always feasible because of the time investment required to setup these assays. The ability to rapidly and precisely identify essential genes in silico is therefore important and has great potential for applications in medicine, biotechnology and basic biological research. Here, we review the advances made in the use of computational methods to predict microbial gene essentiality, perspectives for the future of these techniques and the possible practical applications of essential genes.</abstract><remote-database-name>academic.oup.com</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bfg/article/16/2/70/2453154</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bfg/article-pdf/16/2/70/15538050/elv063.pdf</url><url>https://academic.oup.com/bfg/article/16/2/70/2453154</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-01-02 19:34:48</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chou, Hsin-Hung</author><author>Chiu, Hsuan-Chao</author><author>Delaney, Nigel F.</author><author>Segrè, Daniel</author><author>Marx, Christopher J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diminishing Returns Epistasis Among Beneficial Mutations Decelerates Adaptation</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1190-1192</pages><volume>332</volume><number>6034</number><issue>6034</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011/06/03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0036-8075, 1095-9203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1203799</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Epistasis has substantial impacts on evolution, in particular, the rate of adaptation.

In this study, we experimentally investigated the fitness effects of beneficial mutations that are substituted when populations of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapt to the antibiotic rifampicin. Specifically, we isolated the first beneficial mutation to be fixed by selection when 96 populations of three different genotypes of P. aeruginosa that vary considerably in fitness in the presence of rifampicin were challenged with adapting to a high dose of this antibiotic. The simple genetics of rifampicin resistance allowed us to determine the genetic basis of adaptation in the majority of our populations. We show that the average fitness effects of fixed beneficial mutations show a simple and clear pattern of diminishing returns, such that selection tends to fix mutations with progressively smaller effects as populations approach a peak on the adaptive landscape. The fitness effects of individual mutations, on the other hand, are highly idiosyncratic across genetic backgrounds, revealing pervasive epistasis. In spite of this complexity of genetic interactions in this system, there is an overall tendency toward diminishing-returns epistasis. We argue that a simple overall pattern of diminishing-returns adaptation emerges, despite pervasive epistasis between beneficial mutations, because many beneficial mutations are available, and while the fitness landscape is rugged at the fine scale, it is smooth and regular when we consider the average over possible routes to adaptation.

In this study, we experimentally investigated the fitness effects of beneficial mutations that are substituted when populations of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapt to the antibiotic rifampicin. Specifically, we isolated the first beneficial mutation to be fixed by selection when 96 populations of three different genotypes of P. aeruginosa that vary considerably in fitness in the presence of rifampicin were challenged with adapting to a high dose of this antibiotic. The simple genetics of rifampicin resistance allowed us to determine the genetic basis of adaptation in the majority of our populations. We show that the average fitness effects of fixed beneficial mutations show a simple and clear pattern of diminishing returns, such that selection tends to fix mutations with progressively smaller effects as populations approach a peak on the adaptive landscape. The fitness effects of individual mutations, on the other hand, are highly idiosyncratic across genetic backgrounds, revealing pervasive epistasis. In spite of this complexity of genetic interactions in this system, there is an overall tendency toward diminishing-returns epistasis. We argue that a simple overall pattern of diminishing-returns adaptation emerges, despite pervasive epistasis between beneficial mutations, because many beneficial mutations are available, and while the fitness landscape is rugged at the fine scale, it is smooth and regular when we consider the average over possible routes to adaptation. In the context of antibiotic resistance, these results show that acquiring mutations that confer low levels of antibiotic resistance does not impose any constraint on the ability to evolve high levels of resistance.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.genetics.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.genetics.org/content/186/4/1345</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.genetics.org/content/186/4/1345.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20876562</url><url>http://www.genetics.org/content/186/4/1345.long</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-01-02 16:58:12</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chou, Hsin-Hung</author><author>Chiu, Hsuan-Chao</author><author>Delaney, Nigel F.</author><author>Segrè, Daniel</author><author>Marx, Christopher J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diminishing Returns Epistasis Among Beneficial Mutations Decelerates Adaptation</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1190-1192</pages><volume>332</volume><number>6034</number><issue>6034</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011/06/03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0036-8075, 1095-9203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1203799</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Epistasis has substantial impacts on evolution, in particular, the rate of adaptation. We generated combinations of beneficial mutations that arose in a lineage during rapid adaptation of a bacterium whose growth depended on a newly introduced metabolic pathway. The proportional selective benefit for three of the four loci consistently decreased when they were introduced onto more fit backgrounds. These three alleles all reduced morphological defects caused by expression of the foreign pathway. A simple theoretical model segregating the apparent contribution of individual alleles to benefits and costs effectively predicted the interactions between them.

Whole genome amplification (WGA) is the first step for single-cell sequencing, but its throughput and accuracy are insufficient in conventional reaction platforms. Here, we introduce single droplet multiple displacement amplification (sd-MDA), a method that enables massively parallel amplification of single cell genomes while maintaining sequence accuracy and specificity. Tens of thousands of single cells are compartmentalized in millions of picoliter droplets and then subjected to lysis and WGA by passive droplet fusion in microfluidic channels. Because single cells are isolated in compartments, their genomes are amplified to saturation without contamination. This enables the high-throughput acquisition of contamination-free and cell specific sequence reads from single cells (21,000 single-cells/h), resulting in enhancement of the sequence data quality compared to conventional methods. This method allowed WGA of both single bacterial cells and human cancer cells. The obtained sequencing coverage rivals those of conventional techniques with superior sequence quality. In addition, we also demonstrate de novo assembly of uncultured soil bacteria and obtain draft genomes from single cell sequencing. This sd-MDA is promising for flexible and scalable use in single-cell sequencing.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>En</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05436-4</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05436-4.pdf</url><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05436-4</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-01-02 16:13:46</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blainey, Paul C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The future is now: single-cell genomics of bacteria and archaea</title><secondary-title>FEMS Microbiology Reviews</secondary-title><short-title>The future is now</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FEMS Microbiology Reviews</full-title><abbr-1>FEMS Microbiol Rev</abbr-1></periodical><pages>407-427</pages><volume>37</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013/05/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0168-6445</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1574-6976.12015</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Interest in the expanding catalog of uncultivated microorganisms, increasing recognition of heterogeneity among seemingly similar cells, and technological advances in whole-genome amplification and single-cell manipulation are driving considerable progress in single-cell genomics.

The degree of compaction results from the level of DNA-supercoiling and the presence of nucleoid-binding proteins. DNA-supercoiling is homeostatically maintained by the opposing activities of relaxing DNA topoisomerases and negative supercoil-inducing DNA gyrase. DNA-supercoiling acts as a general cis regulator of transcription, which can be superimposed upon other types of more specific trans regulatory mechanism. Transcriptomic studies on the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, which has a relatively small genome (∼2 Mb) and few nucleoid-binding proteins, have been performed under conditions of local and global changes in supercoiling. The response to local changes induced by fluoroquinolone antibiotics, which target DNA gyrase subunit A and/or topoisomerase IV, involves an increase in oxygen radicals which reduces cell viability, while the induction of global supercoiling changes by novobiocin (a DNA gyrase subunit B inhibitor), or by seconeolitsine (a topoisomerase I inhibitor), has revealed the existence of topological domains that specifically respond to such changes. The control of DNA-supercoiling in S. pneumoniae occurs mainly via the regulation of topoisomerase gene transcription: relaxation triggers the up-regulation of gyrase and the down-regulation of topoisomerases I and IV, while hypernegative supercoiling down-regulates the expression of topoisomerase I. Relaxation affects 13% of the genome, with the majority of the genes affected located in 15 domains. Hypernegative supercoiling affects 10% of the genome, with one quarter of the genes affected located in 12 domains. However, all the above domains overlap, suggesting that the chromosome is organized into topological domains with fixed locations. Based on its response to relaxation, the pneumococcal chromosome can be said to be organized into five types of domain: up-regulated, down-regulated, position-conserved non-regulated, position-variable non-regulated, and AT-rich. The AT content is higher in the up-regulated than in the down-regulated domains. Genes within the different domains share structural and functional characteristics. It would seem that a topology-driven selection pressure has defined the chromosomal location of the metabolism, virulence and competence genes, which suggests the existence of topological rules that aim to improve bacterial fitness.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28824578</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Yifei</author><author>Li, Yi</author><author>Narayan, Rajiv</author><author>Subramanian, Aravind</author><author>Xie, Xiaohui</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gene expression inference with deep learning</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics</full-title><abbr-1>Bioinformatics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1832-1839</pages><volume>32</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016/06/15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1367-4803</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btw074</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Motivation: Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only ∼1000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear regression (LR), limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expressions of genes.Results: We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms LR with 15.33% relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than LR in 99.97% of the target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2921 expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms LR with 6.57% relative improvement, and achieves lower error in 81.31% of the target genes.Availability and implementation: D-GEX is available at https://github.com/uci-cbcl/D-GEX.Contact:xhx@ics.uci.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</abstract><remote-database-name>academic.oup.com</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/12/1832/1743989</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\XPU54AUM\1743989.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-12-22 01:09:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Medini, Duccio</author><author>Donati, Claudio</author><author>Tettelin, Hervé</author><author>Masignani, Vega</author><author>Rappuoli, Rino</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The microbial pan-genome</title><secondary-title>Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development</full-title><abbr-1>Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development</abbr-1></periodical><pages>589-594</pages><volume>15</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>December 1, 2005</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0959-437X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.gde.2005.09.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A decade after the beginning of the genomic era, the question of how genomics can describe a bacterial species has not been fully addressed. Experimental data have shown that in some species new genes are discovered even after sequencing the genomes of several strains. Mathematical modeling predicts that new genes will be discovered even after sequencing hundreds of genomes per species. Therefore, a bacterial species can be described by its pan-genome, which is composed of a ‘core genome’ containing genes present in all strains, and a ’dispensable genome’ containing genes present in two or more strains and genes unique to single strains. Given that the number of unique genes is vast, the pan-genome of a bacterial species might be orders of magnitude larger than any single genome.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X05001759</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\BRZZMQPF\S0959437X05001759.html</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nakamura, Yoji</author><author>Itoh, Takeshi</author><author>Matsuda, Hideo</author><author>Gojobori, Takashi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biased biological functions of horizontally transferred genes in prokaryotic genomes</title><secondary-title>Nature Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>760</pages><volume>36</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004/07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1546-1718</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng1381</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Biased biological functions of horizontally transferred genes in prokaryotic genomes</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>En</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1381</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\4W3WXBJH\Nakamura et al. - 2004 - Biased biological functions of horizontally transf.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\N2343H6E\ng1381.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-12-22 00:32:23</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nakamura, Yoji</author><author>Itoh, Takeshi</author><author>Matsuda, Hideo</author><author>Gojobori, Takashi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biased biological functions of horizontally transferred genes in prokaryotic genomes</title><secondary-title>Nature Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>760</pages><volume>36</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004/07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1546-1718</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng1381</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Biased biological functions of horizontally transferred genes in prokaryotic genomes</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>En</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1381</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\WFDC78WQ\Nakamura et al. - 2004 - Biased biological functions of horizontally transf.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ZSJF9ITD\ng1381.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-12-22 00:29:38</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wiedenbeck, Jane</author><author>Cohan, Frederick M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Origins of bacterial diversity through horizontal genetic transfer and adaptation to new ecological niches</title><secondary-title>FEMS Microbiology Reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FEMS Microbiology Reviews</full-title><abbr-1>FEMS Microbiol Rev</abbr-1></periodical><pages>957-976</pages><volume>35</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011/09/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0168-6445</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00292.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Horizontal genetic transfer (HGT) has played an important role in bacterial evolution at least since the origins of the bacterial divisions, and HGT still facilitates the origins of bacterial diversity, including diversity based on antibiotic resistance.

The results identify metabolic similarities and differences between S. aureus strains that provide insights into the epidemiology of S. aureus and may help to combat its spread., Staphylococcus aureus is a preeminent bacterial pathogen capable of colonizing diverse ecological niches within its human host. We describe here the pangenome of S. aureus based on analysis of genome sequences from 64 strains of S. aureus spanning a range of ecological niches, host types, and antibiotic resistance profiles. Based on this set, S. aureus is expected to have an open pangenome composed of 7,411 genes and a core genome composed of 1,441 genes. Metabolism was highly conserved in this core genome; however, differences were identified in amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways between the strains. Genome-scale models (GEMs) of metabolism were constructed for the 64 strains of S. aureus. These GEMs enabled a systems approach to characterizing the core metabolic and panmetabolic capabilities of the S. aureus species. All models were predicted to be auxotrophic for the vitamins niacin (vitamin B3) and thiamin (vitamin B1), whereas strain-specific auxotrophies were predicted for riboflavin (vitamin B2), guanosine, leucine, methionine, and cysteine, among others. GEMs were used to systematically analyze growth capabilities in more than 300 different growth-supporting environments. The results identified metabolic capabilities linked to pathogenic traits and virulence acquisitions. Such traits can be used to differentiate strains responsible for mild vs. severe infections and preference for hosts (e.g., animals vs. humans). Genome-scale analysis of multiple strains of a species can thus be used to identify metabolic determinants of virulence and increase our understanding of why certain strains of this deadly pathogen have spread rapidly throughout the world.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4932939/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ANESJH4H\Bosi et al. - 2016 - Comparative genome-scale modelling of Staphylococc.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4932939/</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Tonder, Andries J.</author><author>Mistry, Shilan</author><author>Bray, James E.</author><author>Hill, Dorothea M.

The aim of our study was to develop a model to estimate the bacterial core genome from next-generation whole genome sequencing data and use this model to identify novel genes associated with important biological functions. Five bacterial datasets were analysed, comprising 2096 genomes in total. We developed a Bayesian decision model to estimate the number of core genes, calculated pairwise evolutionary distances (p-distances) based on nucleotide sequence diversity, and plotted the median p-distance for each core gene relative to its genome location. We designed visually-informative genome diagrams to depict areas of interest in genomes. Case studies demonstrated how the model could identify areas for further study, e.g. 25% of the core genes with higher sequence diversity in the Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria meningitidis genomes encoded hypothetical proteins. The core gene with the highest p-distance value in C. jejuni was annotated in the reference genome as a putative hydrolase, but further work revealed that it shared sequence homology with beta-lactamase/metallo-beta-lactamases (enzymes that provide resistance to a range of broad-spectrum antibiotics) and thioredoxin reductase genes (which reduce oxidative stress and are essential for DNA replication) in other C. jejuni genomes. Our Bayesian model of estimating the core genome is principled, easy to use and can be applied to large genome datasets. This study also highlighted the lack of knowledge currently available for many core genes in bacterial genomes of significant global public health importance., Whole genome sequencing has revolutionised the study of pathogenic microorganisms. It has also become so affordable that hundreds of samples can reasonably be sequenced in an individual project, creating a wealth of data. Estimating the bacterial core genome – traditionally defined as those genes present in all genomes – is an important initial step in population genomics analyses. We developed a simple statistical model to estimate the number of core genes in a bacterial genome dataset, calculated pairwise evolutionary distances (p-distances) based on differences among nucleotide sequences, and plotted the median p-distance for each core gene relative to its genome location. Low p-distance values indicate highly-conserved genes; high values suggest genes under selection and/or undergoing recombination. The genome diagrams depict areas of interest in genomes that can be explored in further detail. Using our method, we analysed five bacterial species comprising a total of 2096 genomes. This revealed new information related to antibiotic resistance and virulence for two bacterial species and demonstrated that the function of many core genes in bacteria is still unknown. Our model provides a highly-accessible, publicly-available tool to use on the vast quantities of genome sequence data now available.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4140633/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\2JBAKND3\van Tonder et al. - 2014 - Defining the Estimated Core Genome of Bacterial Po.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4140633/</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jensen, Paul A.</author><author>Zhu, Zeyu</author><author>Opijnen, Tim van</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antibiotics Disrupt Coordination between Transcriptional and Phenotypic Stress Responses in Pathogenic Bacteria</title><secondary-title>Cell Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Reports</full-title><abbr-1>Cell Reports</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1705-1716</pages><volume>20</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>data integration</keyword><keyword>metabolic modeling</keyword><keyword>Pseudomonas</keyword><keyword>RNA-seq</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus</keyword><keyword>stress response</keyword><keyword>systems biology</keyword><keyword>Tn-seq</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-08-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2211-1247</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.celrep.2017.07.062</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>www.cell.com</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(17)31041-0</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PVMIHW3J\Jensen et al. - 2017 - Antibiotics Disrupt Coordination between Transcrip.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TJNRSKHD\S2211-1247(17)31041-0.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-08-15 16:09:30</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baltekin, Özden</author><author>Boucharin, Alexis</author><author>Tano, Eva</author><author>Andersson, Dan I.</author><author>Elf, Johan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antibiotic susceptibility testing in less than 30 min using direct single-cell imaging</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>PNAS</abbr-1></periodical><pages>201708558</pages><keywords><keyword>antibiotic</keyword><keyword>AST</keyword><keyword>microfluidic</keyword><keyword>point of care</keyword><keyword>resistance</keyword><keyword>UTI</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-08-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424, 1091-6490</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1708558114</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are aggravated by incorrect prescription and use of antibiotics. A core problem is that there is no sufficiently fast diagnostic test to guide correct antibiotic prescription at the point of care. Here, we investigate if it is possible to develop a point-of-care susceptibility test for urinary tract infection, a disease that 100 million women suffer from annually and that exhibits widespread antibiotic resistance. We capture bacterial cells directly from samples with low bacterial counts (104 cfu/mL) using a custom-designed microfluidic chip and monitor their individual growth rates using microscopy. By averaging the growth rate response to an antibiotic over many individual cells, we can push the detection time to the biological response time of the bacteria. We find that it is possible to detect changes in growth rate in response to each of nine antibiotics that are used to treat urinary tract infections in minutes. In a test of 49 clinical uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) isolates, all were correctly classified as susceptible or resistant to ciprofloxacin in less than 10 min. The total time for antibiotic susceptibility testing, from loading of sample to diagnostic readout, is less than 30 min, which allows the development of a point-of-care test that can guide correct treatment of urinary tract infection.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/08/07/1708558114</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\F293WWJE\Baltekin et al. - 2017 - Antibiotic susceptibility testing in less than 30 .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NSI67VTV\1708558114.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-08-15 15:11:35</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Skwark, Marcin J.</author><author>Croucher, Nicholas J.</author><author>Puranen, Santeri</author><author>Chewapreecha, Claire</author><author>Pesonen, Maiju</author><author>Xu, Ying Ying</author><author>Turner, Paul</author><author>Harris, Simon R.</author><author>Beres, Stephen B.</author><author>Musser, James M.</author><author>Parkhill, Julian</author><author>Bentley, Stephen D.</author><author>Aurell, Erik</author><author>Corander, Jukka</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interacting networks of resistance, virulence and core machinery genes identified by genome-wide epistasis analysis</title><secondary-title>PLOS Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS Genetics</full-title><abbr-1>PLOS Genetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e1006508</pages><volume>13</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Sequence Alignment</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus pyogenes</keyword><keyword>Bacterial genomics</keyword><keyword>Genetic loci</keyword><keyword>Genetic networks</keyword><keyword>Genome-wide association studies</keyword><keyword>Multiple alignment calculation</keyword><keyword>Pneumococcus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>Feb 16, 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1553-7404</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pgen.1006508</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Author summary Epistatic interactions between polymorphisms in DNA are recognized as important drivers of evolution in numerous organisms. Study of epistasis in bacteria has been hampered by the lack of densely sampled population genomic data, suitable statistical models and inference algorithms sufficiently powered for extremely high-dimensional parameter spaces. We introduce the first model-based method for genome-wide epistasis analysis and use two of the largest available bacterial population genome data sets on Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) to demonstrate its potential for biological discovery. Our approach reveals interacting networks of resistance, virulence and core machinery genes in the pneumococcus, which highlights putative candidates for novel drug targets. We also discover a number of plausible targets of co-selection in S. pyogenes linked to RNA pseudouridine synthases. Our method significantly enhances the future potential of epistasis analysis for systems biology, and can complement genome-wide association studies as a means of formulating hypotheses for targeted experimental work.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006508</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\MQ8MQDIT\Skwark et al. - 2017 - Interacting networks of resistance, virulence and .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\WS58B7MT\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-08-15 15:09:51</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Juan, David</author><author>Pazos, Florencio</author><author>Valencia, Alfonso</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emerging methods in protein co-evolution</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Nat Rev Genet</abbr-1></periodical><pages>249-261</pages><volume>14</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Coevolution</keyword><keyword>systems biology</keyword><keyword>Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Evolutionary biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>April 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-0056</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrg3414</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Co-evolution is a fundamental component of the theory of evolution and is essential for understanding the relationships between species in complex ecological networks.

In the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, links between CcpA and virulence have been established, but its role as a master regulator in different nutritional environments remains to be elucidated. Thus, we performed whole-transcriptome and metabolic analyses of S. pneumoniae D39 and its isogenic ccpA mutant during growth on glucose or galactose, rapidly and slowly metabolized carbohydrates presumably encountered by the bacterium in different host niches. CcpA affected the expression of up to 19% of the genome covering multiple cellular processes, including virulence, regulatory networks and central metabolism. Its prevalent function as a repressor was observed on glucose, but unexpectedly also on galactose. Carbohydrate-dependent CcpA regulation was also observed, as for the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway genes, which were activated by galactose and repressed by glucose. Metabolite analyses revealed that two pathways for galactose catabolism are functionally active, despite repression of the Leloir genes by CcpA. Surprisingly, galactose-induced mixed-acid fermentation apparently required CcpA, since genes involved in this type of metabolism were mostly under CcpA-repression. These findings indicate that the role of CcpA extends beyond transcriptional regulation, which seemingly is overlaid by other regulatory mechanisms. In agreement, CcpA influenced the level of many intracellular metabolites potentially involved in metabolic regulation. Our data strengthen the view that a true understanding of cell physiology demands thorough analyses at different cellular levels. Moreover, integration of transcriptional and metabolic data uncovered a link between CcpA and the association of surface molecules (e.g. capsule) to the cell wall. Hence, CcpA may play a key role in mediating the interaction of S. pneumoniae with its host. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that S. pneumoniae optimizes basic metabolic processes, likely enhancing in vivo fitness, in a CcpA-mediated manner.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026707</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\N9NCK9TN\Carvalho et al. - 2011 - CcpA Ensures Optimal Metabolic Fitness of Streptoc.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\UR3BI95B\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-08-15 15:09:23</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ravasz, E.</author><author>Somera, A.

Such a process is fundamentally iterative, where each iteration involves making model predictions, obtaining experimental data, reconciling the predicted outcomes with experimental ones, and using discrepancies to update the in silico model. Here we have reconstructed, on the basis of information derived from literature and databases, the first integrated genome-scale computational model of a transcriptional regulatory and metabolic network. The model accounts for 1,010 genes in Escherichia coli, including 104 regulatory genes whose products together with other stimuli regulate the expression of 479 of the 906 genes in the reconstructed metabolic network. This model is able not only to predict the outcomes of high-throughput growth phenotyping and gene expression experiments, but also to indicate knowledge gaps and identify previously unknown components and interactions in the regulatory and metabolic networks. We find that a systems biology approach that combines genome-scale experimentation and computation can systematically generate hypotheses on the basis of disparate data sources.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v429/n6987/full/nature02456.html</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\D562EFCD\Covert et al. - 2004 - Integrating high-throughput and computational data.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\5FNHBXUV\nature02456.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-06-28 22:16:18</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Förster, Jochen</author><author>Famili, Iman</author><author>Fu, Patrick</author><author>Palsson, Bernhard Ø.</author><author>Nielsen, Jens</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-Scale Reconstruction of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Metabolic Network</title><secondary-title>Genome Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Research</full-title><abbr-1>Genome Res</abbr-1></periodical><pages>244-253</pages><volume>13</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003-2-1</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1088-9051</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.234503</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The metabolic network in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was reconstructed using currently available genomic, biochemical, and physiological information. The metabolic reactions were compartmentalized between the cytosol and the mitochondria, and transport steps between the compartments and the environment were included. A total of 708 structural open reading frames (ORFs) were accounted for in the reconstructed network, corresponding to 1035 metabolic reactions. Further, 140 reactions were included on the basis of biochemical evidence resulting in a genome-scale reconstructed metabolic network containing 1175 metabolic reactions and 584 metabolites. The number of gene functions included in the reconstructed network corresponds to ∼16% of all characterized ORFs in S. cerevisiae. Using the reconstructed network, the metabolic capabilities of S. cerevisiae were calculated and compared with Escherichia coli. The reconstructed metabolic network is the first comprehensive network for a eukaryotic organism, and it may be used as the basis for in silico analysis of phenotypic functions., [Supplemental material is available online at www.genome.org.

The annotated sequence, biochemical information, and other information were used to reconstruct the E. coli metabolic map. The stoichiometric coefficients for each metabolic enzyme in the E. coli metabolic map were assembled to construct a genome-specific stoichiometric matrix. The E. coli stoichiometric matrix was used to define the system's characteristics and the capabilities of E. coli metabolism. The effects of gene deletions in the central metabolic pathways on the ability of the in silico metabolic network to support growth were assessed, and the in silico predictions were compared with experimental observations. It was shown that based on stoichiometric and capacity constraints the in silico analysis was able to qualitatively predict the growth potential of mutant strains in 86% of the cases examined. Herein, it is demonstrated that the synthesis of in silico metabolic genotypes based on genomic, biochemical, and strain-specific information is possible, and that systems analysis methods are available to analyze and interpret the metabolic phenotype.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC25862/</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC25862/pdf/pq005528.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC25862/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-06-28 22:01:21</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bergmann, Sven</author><author>Ihmels, Jan</author><author>Barkai, Naama</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Similarities and Differences in Genome-Wide Expression Data of Six Organisms</title><secondary-title>PLOS Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS Biology</full-title><abbr-1>PLOS Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e9</pages><volume>2</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</keyword><keyword>Comparative genomics</keyword><keyword>Gene regulation</keyword><keyword>Caenorhabditis elegans</keyword><keyword>DNA transcription</keyword><keyword>Gene expression</keyword><keyword>Invertebrate genomics</keyword><keyword>Organismal evolution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>Dec 15, 2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1545-7885</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pbio.0020009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Comparative analysis of sequence and gene expression data from bacteria, yeast, worms, flies, weeds, and humans hints at the potential to extract biological and evolutionary principles.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020009</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6HX3NWM3\Bergmann et al. - 2003 - Similarities and Differences in Genome-Wide Expres.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\UCNFJU2G\Bergmann et al. - 2003 - Similarities and Differences in Genome-Wide Expres.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-06-28 21:48:06</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halfon, Marc S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Perspectives on Gene Regulatory Network Evolution</title><secondary-title>Trends in Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in Genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Trends in Genetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>436-447</pages><volume>33</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>cis-regulatory module</keyword><keyword>developmental system drift</keyword><keyword>DSD</keyword><keyword>enhancer evolution</keyword><keyword>evodevo</keyword><keyword>GRN</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-07-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0168-9525</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tig.2017.04.005</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>www.cell.com</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/abstract/S0168-9525(17)30070-7</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.cell.com/article/S0168952517300707/pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28528721, 28528721</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\BPHDK6BP\Halfon - 2017 - Perspectives on Gene Regulatory Network Evolution.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-06-28 15:47:12</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hasty, Jeff</author><author>McMillen, David</author><author>Isaacs, Farren</author><author>Collins, James J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computational studies of gene regulatory networks: in numero molecular biology</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Genetics</secondary-title><short-title>Computational studies of gene regulatory networks</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Nat Rev Genet</abbr-1></periodical><pages>268-279</pages><volume>2</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>April 2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-0056</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/35066056</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Remarkable progress in genomic research is leading to a complete map of the building blocks of biology.

The outcome of network inference therefore varies between tools and can be highly complementary.

Using chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C), we derive ∼13 kb resolution 3D models of the Caulobacter genome. The resulting models illustrate that the genome is ellipsoidal with periodically arranged arms. The parS sites, a pair of short contiguous sequence elements known to be involved in chromosome segregation, are positioned at one pole, where they anchor the chromosome to the cell and contribute to the formation of a compact chromatin conformation. Repositioning these elements resulted in rotations of the chromosome that changed the subcellular positions of most genes. Such rotations did not lead to large-scale changes in gene expression, indicating that genome folding does not strongly affect gene regulation. Collectively, our data suggest that genome folding is globally dictated by the parS sites and chromosome segregation.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276511007593</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276511007593/pdfft?md5=9e8ec155d24aaf9644a38f33777b5605&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S1097276511007593-main.pdf</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\VN22I5BV\Umbarger et al. - 2011 - The Three-Dimensional Architecture of a Bacterial .html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-06-09 23:08:38</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Penadés, José R</author><author>Chen, John</author><author>Quiles-Puchalt, Nuria</author><author>Carpena, Nuria</author><author>Novick, Richard P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bacteriophage-mediated spread of bacterial virulence genes</title><secondary-title>Current Opinion in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current Opinion in Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Current Opinion in Microbiology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>171-178</pages><volume>23</volume><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>February 1, 2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1369-5274</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mib.2014.11.019</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Bacteriophages are types of viruses that infect bacteria. They are the most abundant and diverse entities in the biosphere, and influence the evolution of most bacterial species by promoting gene transfer, sometimes in unexpected ways. Although pac-type phages can randomly package and transfer bacterial DNA by a process called generalized transduction, some mobile genetic elements have developed elegant and sophisticated strategies to hijack the phage DNA-packaging machinery for their own transfer. Moreover, phage-like particles (gene transfer agents) have also evolved, that can package random pieces of the producing cell's genome.

In order to understand the extent to which genomic variation occurs in a species, the construction of its pangenome is necessary. The pangenome represents the complete set of genes of a species; it is composed of core genes, which are present in all individuals, and variable genes, which are present only in some individuals. Aside from variations at the gene level, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are also an important form of genetic variation. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) coupled with the heritability of SNPs make them ideal markers for genetic analysis of human, animal, and microbial data. SNPs have also been extensively used in crop genetics for association mapping, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, analysis of genetic diversity, and phylogenetic analysis. This review focuses on the use of pangenomes for SNP discovery. It highlights the advantages of using a pangenome rather than a single reference for this purpose. This review also demonstrates how extra information not captured in a single reference alone can be used to provide additional support for linking genotypic data to phenotypic data.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.mdpi.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/6/1/21</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NZHPKUAG\Hurgobin and Edwards - 2017 - SNP Discovery Using a Pangenome Has the Single Re.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\I4FKU7RN\21.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-06-09 22:53:33</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jia, Baofeng</author><author>Raphenya, Amogelang R.</author><author>Alcock, Brian</author><author>Waglechner, Nicholas</author><author>Guo, Peiyao</author><author>Tsang, Kara K.</author><author>Lago, Briony A.</author><author>Dave, Biren M.</author><author>Pereira, Sheldon</author><author>Sharma, Arjun N.</author><author>Doshi, Sachin</author><author>Courtot, Mélanie</author><author>Lo, Raymond</author><author>Williams, Laura E.</author><author>Frye, Jonathan G.</author><author>Elsayegh, Tariq</author><author>Sardar, Daim</author><author>Westman, Erin L.</author><author>Pawlowski, Andrew C.</author><author>Johnson, Timothy A.</author><author>Brinkman, Fiona S.

In particular, there are few tools to study the genetics and genomics of antibiotic resistance and how it impacts bacterial populations, ecology, and the clinic. We have initiated development of such tools in the form of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database (CARD; http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca). The CARD integrates disparate molecular and sequence data, provides a unique organizing principle in the form of the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), and can quickly identify putative antibiotic resistance genes in new unannotated genome sequences.

A pneumococcal genome-wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated a strong correlation between 30-day mortality and the presence of the phage-derived gene pblB, encoding a platelet-binding protein whose effects on platelet activation were previously unknown. Platelets are increasingly recognized as key players of the innate immune system, and in sepsis, excessive platelet activation contributes to microvascular obstruction, tissue hypoperfusion, and finally multiorgan failure, leading to mortality. Our in vitro studies revealed that pblB expression was induced by fluoroquinolones but not by the beta-lactam antibiotic penicillin G. Subsequently, we determined pblB induction and platelet activation by incubating whole blood with the wild type or a pblB knockout mutant in the presence or absence of antibiotics commonly administered to our patient cohort. pblB-dependent enhancement of platelet activation, as measured by increased expression of the α-granule protein P-selectin, the binding of fibrinogen to the activated αIIbβ3 receptor, and the formation of platelet-monocyte complex occurred irrespective of antibiotic exposure. In conclusion, the presence of pblB on the pneumococcal chromosome potentially leads to increased mortality in patients with an invasive S. pneumoniae infection, which may be explained by enhanced platelet activation. This study highlights the clinical utility of a bacterial GWAS, followed by functional characterization, to identify bacterial factors involved in disease severity.&#xD;IMPORTANCE The exact mechanisms causing mortality in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) patients are not completely understood. We examined 349 patients with IPD and found in a bacterial genome-wide association study (GWAS) that the presence of the phage-derived gene pblB was associated with mortality in the first 30 days after hospitalization. Although pblB has been extensively studied in Streptococcus mitis, its consequence for the interaction between platelets and Streptococcus pneumoniae is largely unknown. Platelets are important in immunity and inflammation, and excessive platelet activation contributes to microvascular obstruction and multiorgan failure, leading to mortality. We therefore developed this study to assess whether the expression of pblB might increase the risk of death for IPD patients through its effect on enhanced platelet activation. This study also shows the value of integrating extensive bacterial genomics and clinical data in predicting and understanding pathogen virulence, which in turn will help to improve prognosis and therapy.</abstract><remote-database-name>mbio.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://mbio.asm.org/content/8/1/e01984-16</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\B3KUEKQR\Tunjungputri et al. - 2017 - Phage-Derived Protein Induces Increased Platelet A.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28096486</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\9KPVWKTV\e01984-16.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-06-09 19:21:48</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ebrahim, Ali</author><author>Lerman, Joshua A.</author><author>Palsson, Bernhard O.</author><author>Hyduke, Daniel R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>COBRApy: COnstraints-Based Reconstruction and Analysis for Python</title><secondary-title>BMC Systems Biology</secondary-title><short-title>COBRApy</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Systems Biology</full-title><abbr-1>BMC Systems Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>74</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>Gene expression</keyword><keyword>Constraint-based modeling</keyword><keyword>Genome-scale</keyword><keyword>Metabolism</keyword><keyword>Network reconstruction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1752-0509</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1752-0509-7-74</electronic-resource-num><abstract>COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

We show that genomic positioning of ribosomal protein genes is crucial for physiology by providing replication-dependent higher dosage. Therefore it might play a key role in genome evolution of bacterial species. This work will contribute to discover genomic rules governing cell physiology which will be essential in the context of the creation of new artificial life forms.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005156</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\P3MB2UJW\Soler-Bistué et al. - 2015 - Genomic Location of the Major Ribosomal Protein Ge.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PAN4XUU8\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-06-05 18:16:48</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Croucher, Nicholas J.</author><author>Finkelstein, Jonathan A.</author><author>Pelton, Stephen I.</author><author>Mitchell, Patrick K.</author><author>Lee, Grace M.</author><author>Parkhill, Julian</author><author>Bentley, Stephen D.</author><author>Hanage, William P.</author><author>Lipsitch, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Population genomics of post-vaccine changes in pneumococcal epidemiology</title><secondary-title>Nature Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Nat Genet</abbr-1></periodical><pages>656-663</pages><volume>45</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Microbial genetics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>June 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1061-4036</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng.2625</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Whole-genome sequencing of 616 asymptomatically carried Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was used to study the impact of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

Here we demonstrate that the alignment-free analysis method feature frequency profiling (FFP) can be used to rapidly construct phylogenetic trees of draft bacterial genome sequences on a standard desktop computer and that coupling with in silico genotyping methods gives useful information for comparative and clinical genomic and molecular epidemiology applications. FFP-based phylogenetic trees of seven gastric Helicobacter species matched those obtained by analysis of 16S rRNA genes and ribosomal proteins, and FFP- and core genome single nucleotide polymorphism-based analysis of 63 H. pylori genomes again showed comparable phylogenetic clustering, consistent with genomotypes assigned by using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Analysis of 377 H. pylori genomes highlighted the conservation of genomotypes and linkage with phylogeographic characteristics and predicted the presence of an incomplete or nonfunctional cag pathogenicity island in 18/276 genomes. In silico analysis of antibiotic susceptibility markers suggests that most H. pylori hspAmerind and hspEAsia isolates are predicted to carry the T2812C mutation potentially conferring low-level clarithromycin resistance, while levels of metronidazole resistance were similar in all multilocus sequence types. In conclusion, the use of FFP phylogenetic clustering and in silico genotyping allows determination of genome evolution and phylogeographic clustering and can contribute to clinical microbiology by genomotyping for outbreak management and the prediction of pathogenic potential and antibiotic susceptibility.</abstract><remote-database-name>jcm.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://jcm.asm.org/content/53/9/2877</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\S282CRA9\Vliet and Kusters - 2015 - Use of Alignment-Free Phylogenetics for Rapid Geno.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26135867</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\VN7NRF8I\Vliet and Kusters - 2015 - Use of Alignment-Free Phylogenetics for Rapid Geno.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-05-11 12:25:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tonder, Andries J. van</author><author>Mistry, Shilan</author><author>Bray, James E.</author><author>Hill, Dorothea M.

It has also become so affordable that hundreds of samples can reasonably be sequenced in an individual project, creating a wealth of data. Estimating the bacterial core genome – traditionally defined as those genes present in all genomes – is an important initial step in population genomics analyses. We developed a simple statistical model to estimate the number of core genes in a bacterial genome dataset, calculated pairwise evolutionary distances (p-distances) based on differences among nucleotide sequences, and plotted the median p-distance for each core gene relative to its genome location. Low p-distance values indicate highly-conserved genes; high values suggest genes under selection and/or undergoing recombination. The genome diagrams depict areas of interest in genomes that can be explored in further detail. Using our method, we analysed five bacterial species comprising a total of 2096 genomes. This revealed new information related to antibiotic resistance and virulence for two bacterial species and demonstrated that the function of many core genes in bacteria is still unknown. Our model provides a highly-accessible, publicly-available tool to use on the vast quantities of genome sequence data now available.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003788</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\UK2Q7ZAZ\Tonder et al. - 2014 - Defining the Estimated Core Genome of Bacterial Po.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\MXA2EQ3H\Tonder et al. - 2014 - Defining the Estimated Core Genome of Bacterial Po.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-05-11 12:25:19</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Zhipeng</author><author>Dang, Yunkun</author><author>Zhou, Mian</author><author>Li, Lin</author><author>Yu, Chien-hung</author><author>Fu, Jingjing</author><author>Chen, She</author><author>Liu, Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Codon usage is an important determinant of gene expression levels largely through its effects on transcription</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</abbr-1></periodical><pages>E6117-E6125</pages><volume>113</volume><number>41</number><issue>41</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-10-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1606724113</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Codon usage bias is an essential feature of all genomes. The effects of codon usage biases on gene expression were previously thought to be mainly due to its impacts on translation. Here, we show that codon usage bias strongly correlates with protein and mRNA levels genome-wide in the filamentous fungus Neurospora, and codon usage is an important determinant of gene expression. Surprisingly, we found that the impacts of codon usage on gene expression are mainly due to effects on transcription and are largely independent of translation. Together, these results uncovered an unexpected role of codon biases in determining transcription levels by affecting chromatin structures and suggest that codon biases are results of genome adaptation to both transcription and translation machineries., Codon usage biases are found in all eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, and preferred codons are more frequently used in highly expressed genes. The effects of codon usage on gene expression were previously thought to be mainly mediated by its impacts on translation. Here, we show that codon usage strongly correlates with both protein and mRNA levels genome-wide in the filamentous fungus Neurospora. Gene codon optimization also results in strong up-regulation of protein and RNA levels, suggesting that codon usage is an important determinant of gene expression. Surprisingly, we found that the impact of codon usage on gene expression results mainly from effects on transcription and is largely independent of mRNA translation and mRNA stability. Furthermore, we show that histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation is one of the mechanisms responsible for the codon usage-mediated transcriptional silencing of some genes with nonoptimal codons. Together, these results uncovered an unexpected important role of codon usage in ORF sequences in determining transcription levels and suggest that codon biases are an adaptation of protein coding sequences to both transcription and translation machineries. Therefore, synonymous codons not only specify protein sequences and translation dynamics, but also help determine gene expression levels.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068308/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\BHGQEMW6\Zhou et al. - 2016 - Codon usage is an important determinant of gene ex.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068308/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-05-01 02:53:03</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Head, Steven R.</author><author>Komori, H.

A novel method is described by which the enzymatic activity of newly synthesized luciferase can be monitored continuously in the cell-free system while this protein is being translated from its mRNA. It is shown that ribosome-bound polypeptide chains have no detectable enzymatic activity, but that this activity appears within a few seconds after luciferase has been released from the ribosome. In contrast, the renaturation of denatured luciferase under identical conditions occurs with a half-time of 14 min.

In theory, the frequency with which ribosomes are observed positioned over each type of codon can be used to quantify the speed with which each codon is translated. In practice, ribosome profiling experiments in yeast that use translation inhibitors to arrest translation before measuring the positions of ribosomes report very different apparent translation speeds for each codon than experiments that do not use inhibitors. To explain this inconsistency, we show that a previously unappreciated mechanism causes experiments using translation inhibitors to not measure ribosomes at each position on mRNAs in proportion to the actual amount of time spent there in vivo. Understanding this mechanism reveals that experiments without inhibitors more accurately measure translation dynamics and provides guidance for the design and interpretation of future ribosome profiling experiments.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005732</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\Q45P6Z7M\Hussmann et al. - 2015 - Understanding Biases in Ribosome Profiling Experim.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\GHRTGX5G\Hussmann et al. - 2015 - Understanding Biases in Ribosome Profiling Experim.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-05-01 00:40:27</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ingolia, Nicholas T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ribosome profiling: new views of translation, from single codons to genome scale</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Genetics</secondary-title><short-title>Ribosome profiling</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Nat Rev Genet</abbr-1></periodical><pages>205-213</pages><volume>15</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Gene regulation</keyword><keyword>Translation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>March 2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-0056</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrg3645</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Genome-wide analyses of gene expression have so far focused on the abundance of mRNA species as measured either by microarray or, more recently, by RNA sequencing.

We exploit the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose translation changes after differentiation. We also define a class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding RNAs (sprcRNAs) that encode small proteins.

In this work, we analyzed the codon usage of adenoviral proteins by principal component analysis and assessed their codon adaptation to the host. We observed a general clustering of adenoviral proteins according to their function. However, there was a significant variation in the codon preference between the host-interacting fiber protein and the rest of structural late phase proteins, with a non-optimal codon usage of the fiber. To understand the impact of codon bias in the fiber, we optimized the Adenovirus-5 fiber to the codon usage of the hexon structural protein. The optimized fiber displayed increased expression in a non-viral context. However, infection with adenoviruses containing the optimized fiber resulted in decreased expression of the fiber and of wild-type structural proteins. Consequently, this led to a drastic reduction in viral release. The insertion of an exogenous optimized protein as a late gene in the adenovirus with the optimized fiber further interfered with viral fitness. These results highlight the importance of balancing codon usage in viral proteins to adequately exploit cellular resources for efficient infection and open new opportunities to regulate viral fitness for virotherapy and vaccine development.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27278133</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fu, Jingjing</author><author>Murphy, Katherine A.</author><author>Zhou, Mian</author><author>Li, Ying H.</author><author>Lam, Vu H.</author><author>Tabuloc, Christine A.</author><author>Chiu, Joanna C.</author><author>Liu, Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Codon usage affects the structure and function of the Drosophila circadian clock protein PERIOD</title><secondary-title>Genes &amp; Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes &amp; Development</full-title><abbr-1>Genes Dev.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1761-1775</pages><volume>30</volume><number>15</number><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>circadian clock</keyword><keyword>codon usage</keyword><keyword>Drosophila</keyword><keyword>period</keyword><keyword>protein structure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>Aug 01, 2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1549-5477</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gad.281030.116</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Codon usage bias is a universal feature of all genomes, but its in vivo biological functions in animal systems are not clear. To investigate the in vivo role of codon usage in animals, we took advantage of the sensitivity and robustness of the Drosophila circadian system. By codon-optimizing parts of Drosophila period (dper), a core clock gene that encodes a critical component of the circadian oscillator, we showed that dper codon usage is important for circadian clock function. Codon optimization of dper resulted in conformational changes of the dPER protein, altered dPER phosphorylation profile and stability, and impaired dPER function in the circadian negative feedback loop, which manifests into changes in molecular rhythmicity and abnormal circadian behavioral output. This study provides an in vivo example that demonstrates the role of codon usage in determining protein structure and function in an animal system. These results suggest a universal mechanism in eukaryotes that uses a codon usage "code" within genetic codons to regulate cotranslational protein folding.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542830</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burgess-Brown, Nicola A.</author><author>Sharma, Sujata</author><author>Sobott, Frank</author><author>Loenarz, Christoph</author><author>Oppermann, Udo</author><author>Gileadi, Opher</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Codon optimization can improve expression of human genes in Escherichia coli: A multi-gene study</title><secondary-title>Protein Expression and Purification</secondary-title><short-title>Codon optimization can improve expression of human genes in Escherichia coli</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Protein Expression and Purification</full-title><abbr-1>Protein Expr.

Approaches normally used to overcome this problem include targeted mutagenesis to remove rare codons or the addition of rare codon tRNAs in specific cell lines. Recently, improvements in technology have enabled cost-effective production of synthetic genes, making this a feasible alternative. To explore this option, the expression patterns in E. coli of 30 human short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase genes (SDRs) were analyzed in three independent experiments, comparing the native and synthetic (codon-optimized) versions of each gene. The constructs were prepared in a pET-derived vector that appends an N-terminal polyhistidine tag to the protein; expression was induced using IPTG and soluble proteins were isolated by Ni-NTA metal-affinity chromatography. Expression of the native and synthetic gene constructs was compared in two isogenic bacterial strains, one of which contained a plasmid (pRARE2) that carries seven tRNAs recognizing rare codons. Although we found some degree of variability between experiments, in normal E. coli synthetic genes could be expressed and purified more readily than the native version. In only one case was native gene expression better. Importantly, in most but not all cases, expression of the native genes in combination with rare codon tRNAs mimicked the behavior of the synthetic genes in the native strain. The trend is that heterologous expression of some proteins in bacteria can be improved by altering codon preference, but that this effect can be generally recapitulated by introducing rare codon tRNAs into the host cell.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18289875</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharp, P M</author><author>Tuohy, T M</author><author>Mosurski, K R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Codon usage in yeast: cluster analysis clearly differentiates highly and lowly expressed genes.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acids Research</secondary-title><short-title>Codon usage in yeast</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic Acids Research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucleic Acids Res</abbr-1></periodical><pages>5125-5143</pages><volume>14</volume><number>13</number><issue>13</issue><dates><year>1986</year><pub-dates><date>1986-7-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0305-1048</isbn><abstract>Codon usage data has been compiled for 110 yeast genes. Cluster analysis on relative synonymous codon usage revealed two distinct groups of genes. One group corresponds to highly expressed genes, and has much more extreme synonymous codon preference. The pattern of codon usage observed is consistent with that expected if a need to match abundant tRNAs, and intermediacy of tRNA-mRNA interaction energies are important selective constraints. Thus codon usage in the highly expressed group shows a higher correlation with tRNA abundance, a greater degree of third base pyrimidine bias, and a lesser tendency to the A+T richness which is characteristic of the yeast genome. The cluster analysis can be used to predict the likely level of gene expression of any gene, and identifies the pattern of codon usage likely to yield optimal gene expression in yeast.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC311530/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\X5G8BDES\Sharp et al. - 1986 - Codon usage in yeast cluster analysis clearly dif.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC311530/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-04-30 23:48:02</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reis, Mario dos</author><author>Savva, Renos</author><author>Wernisch, Lorenz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Solving the riddle of codon usage preferences: a test for translational selection</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acids Research</secondary-title><short-title>Solving the riddle of codon usage preferences</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic Acids Research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucleic Acids Res</abbr-1></periodical><pages>5036-5044</pages><volume>32</volume><number>17</number><issue>17</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0305-1048</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkh834</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Translational selection is responsible for the unequal usage of synonymous codons in protein coding genes in a wide variety of organisms. It is one of the most subtle and pervasive forces of molecular evolution, yet, establishing the underlying causes for its idiosyncratic behaviour across living kingdoms has proven elusive to researchers over the past 20 years. In this study, a statistical model for measuring translational selection in any given genome is developed, and the test is applied to 126 fully sequenced genomes, ranging from archaea to eukaryotes. It is shown that tRNA gene redundancy and genome size are interacting forces that ultimately determine the action of translational selection, and that an optimal genome size exists for which this kind of selection is maximal. Accordingly, genome size also presents upper and lower boundaries beyond which selection on codon usage is not possible. We propose a model where the coevolution of genome size and tRNA genes explains the observed patterns in translational selection in all living organisms. This model finally unifies our understanding of codon usage across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Helicobacter pylori, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens are codon usage paradigms that can be better understood under the proposed model.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC521650/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\HTCX3HVK\Reis et al. - 2004 - Solving the riddle of codon usage preferences a t.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC521650/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-04-30 23:46:44</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Mian</author><author>Guo, Jinhu</author><author>Cha, Joonseok</author><author>Chae, Michael</author><author>Chen, She</author><author>Barral, Jose M.</author><author>Sachs, Matthew S.</author><author>Liu, Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Non-optimal codon usage affects expression, structure and function of clock protein FRQ</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title><abbr-1>Nature</abbr-1></periodical><pages>111-115</pages><volume>495</volume><number>7439</number><issue>7439</issue><keywords><keyword>Phosphorylation</keyword><keyword>Protein Conformation</keyword><keyword>Open Reading Frames</keyword><keyword>Fungal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal</keyword><keyword>Codon</keyword><keyword>Circadian Clocks</keyword><keyword>Circadian Rhythm</keyword><keyword>CLOCK Proteins</keyword><keyword>Feedback, Physiological</keyword><keyword>Neurospora crassa</keyword><keyword>Protein Stability</keyword><keyword>Trypsin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>Mar 07, 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1476-4687</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature11833</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Codon-usage bias has been observed in almost all genomes and is thought to result from selection for efficient and accurate translation of highly expressed genes. Codon usage is also implicated in the control of transcription, splicing and RNA structure. Many genes exhibit little codon-usage bias, which is thought to reflect a lack of selection for messenger RNA translation. Alternatively, however, non-optimal codon usage may be of biological importance. The rhythmic expression and the proper function of the Neurospora FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein are essential for circadian clock function. Here we show that, unlike most genes in Neurospora, frq exhibits non-optimal codon usage across its entire open reading frame. Optimization of frq codon usage abolishes both overt and molecular circadian rhythms. Codon optimization not only increases FRQ levels but, unexpectedly, also results in conformational changes in FRQ protein, altered FRQ phosphorylation profile and stability, and impaired functions in the circadian feedback loops. These results indicate that non-optimal codon usage of frq is essential for its circadian clock function. Our study provides an example of how non-optimal codon usage functions to regulate protein expression and to achieve optimal protein structure and function.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23417067</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aronson, S.

The reads are first aligned to the reference genome using one of the tools available for this task. Tn-seq Explorer reads the alignment and the gene annotation, and provides the user with a set of tools to investigate the data and identify possibly essential or advantageous genes as those that contain significantly low counts of transposon insertions.

Codon usage has been proposed to play a role in regulating translation kinetics and co-translational protein folding. The relationship between codon usage and protein structures and the in vivo role of codon usage in eukaryotic protein folding is not clear. Here, we show that there is a strong codon usage bias in the filamentous fungus Neurospora. Importantly, we found genome-wide correlations between codon choices and predicted protein secondary structures: Nonoptimal codons are preferentially used in intrinsically disordered regions, and more optimal codons are used in structured domains. The functional importance of such correlations in vivo was confirmed by structure-based codon manipulation of codons in the Neurospora circadian clock gene frequency (frq). The codon optimization of the predicted disordered, but not well-structured regions of FRQ impairs clock function and altered FRQ structures. Furthermore, the correlations between codon usage and protein disorder tendency are conserved in other eukaryotes. Together, these results suggest that codon choices and protein structures co-evolve to ensure proper protein folding in eukaryotic organisms.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26032251</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pechmann, Sebastian</author><author>Chartron, Justin W.</author><author>Frydman, Judith</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Local slowdown of translation by nonoptimal codons promotes nascent-chain recognition by SRP in vivo</title><secondary-title>Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Nat.

We report that synonymous codon choice is tuned to promote interaction of nascent polypeptides with the signal recognition particle (SRP), which assists in protein translocation across membranes. Cotranslational recognition by the SRP in vivo is enhanced when mRNAs contain nonoptimal codon clusters 35-40 codons downstream of the SRP-binding site, the distance that spans the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel. A local translation slowdown upon ribosomal exit of SRP-binding elements in mRNAs containing these nonoptimal codon clusters is supported experimentally by ribosome profiling analyses in yeast. Modulation of local elongation rates through codon choice appears to kinetically enhance recognition by ribosome-associated factors. We propose that cotranslational regulation of nascent-chain fate may be a general constraint shaping codon usage in the genome.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25420103</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kimchi-Sarfaty, Chava</author><author>Oh, Jung Mi</author><author>Kim, In-Wha</author><author>Sauna, Zuben E.</author><author>Calcagno, Anna Maria</author><author>Ambudkar, Suresh V.</author><author>Gottesman, Michael M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A "silent" polymorphism in the MDR1 gene changes substrate specificity</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title><abbr-1>Science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>525-528</pages><volume>315</volume><number>5811</number><issue>5811</issue><keywords><keyword>Protein Conformation</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Protein Structure, Tertiary</keyword><keyword>RNA, Messenger</keyword><keyword>Cell Membrane</keyword><keyword>Codon</keyword><keyword>Protein Biosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Protein Folding</keyword><keyword>Cell Line</keyword><keyword>Cercopithecus aethiops</keyword><keyword>Cyclosporine</keyword><keyword>Genes, MDR</keyword><keyword>Haplotypes</keyword><keyword>HeLa Cells</keyword><keyword>Mutagenesis, Site-Directed</keyword><keyword>P-Glycoprotein</keyword><keyword>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Rhodamine 123</keyword><keyword>Sirolimus</keyword><keyword>Substrate Specificity</keyword><keyword>Transfection</keyword><keyword>Verapamil</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>Jan 26, 2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1095-9203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1135308</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not produce altered coding sequences, and therefore they are not expected to change the function of the protein in which they occur.

To better understand the manner in which TRiC interacts with newly translated polypeptides, we examined its association with nascent chains using a photo-cross-linking approach. To this end, a series of ribosome-bound nascent chains of defined lengths was prepared using truncated mRNAs. Photoactivatable probes were incorporated into these (35)S- labeled nascent chains during translation. Upon photolysis, TRiC was cross-linked to ribosome-bound polypeptides exposing at least 50-90 amino acids outside the ribosomal exit channel, indicating that the chaperonin associates with much shorter nascent chains than indicated by previous studies. Cross-links were observed for nascent chains of the cytosolic proteins actin, luciferase, and enolase, but not to ribosome-bound preprolactin. The pattern of cross-links became more complex as the nascent chain increased in length. These results suggest a chain length-dependent increase in the number of TRiC subunits involved in the interaction that is consistent with the idea that the substrate participates in subunit-specific contacts with the chaperonin. Both ribosome isolation by centrifugation through sucrose cushions and immunoprecipitation with anti-puromycin antibodies demonstrated that the photoadducts form on ribosome-bound polypeptides. Our results indicate that TRiC/CCT associates with the translating polypeptide shortly after it emerges from the ribosome and suggest a close association between the chaperonin and the translational apparatus.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10791973</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Konstantinidis, Konstantinos T</author><author>Ramette, Alban</author><author>Tiedje, James M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The bacterial species definition in the genomic era</title><secondary-title>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1929-1940</pages><volume>361</volume><number>1475</number><issue>1475</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006-11-29</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0962-8436</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rstb.2006.1920</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The bacterial species definition, despite its eminent practical significance for identification, diagnosis, quarantine and diversity surveys, remains a very difficult issue to advance. Genomics now offers novel insights into intra-species diversity and the potential for emergence of a more soundly based system. Although we share the excitement, we argue that it is premature for a universal change to the definition because current knowledge is based on too few phylogenetic groups and too few samples of natural populations. Our analysis of five important bacterial groups suggests, however, that more stringent standards for species may be justifiable when a solid understanding of gene content and ecological distinctiveness becomes available. Our analysis also reveals what is actually encompassed in a species according to the current standards, in terms of whole-genome sequence and gene-content diversity, and shows that this does not correspond to coherent clusters for the environmental Burkholderia and Shewanella genera examined. In contrast, the obligatory pathogens, which have a very restricted ecological niche, do exhibit clusters. Therefore, the idea of biologically meaningful clusters of diversity that applies to most eukaryotes may not be universally applicable in the microbial world, or if such clusters exist, they may be found at different levels of distinction.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1764935/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\584IH8JR\Konstantinidis et al. - 2006 - The bacterial species definition in the genomic er.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1764935/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-02-16 18:32:32</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arbique, Judy C.</author><author>Poyart, Claire</author><author>Trieu-Cuot, Patrick</author><author>Quesne, Gilles</author><author>Carvalho, Maria da Glória S.</author><author>Steigerwalt, Arnold G.</author><author>Morey, Roger E.</author><author>Jackson, Delois</author><author>Davidson, Ross J.</author><author>Facklam, Richard R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Accuracy of Phenotypic and Genotypic Testing for Identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Description of Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae sp. nov.</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Importantly, the genetic background of an individual has a significant effect on the genesis of these complications. The presence of these metabolic complications has been closely associated with alterations in the intestinal microbiota, implicating the microbiota as a modifier of metabolic disease risk. To examine the predictive potential of the microbiota in the early onset effects of a fructose-rich diet, we selected four mouse strains; A/J is a common strain which is resistant to diet-induced IR and obesity, C57BL6/J is on the other hand highly susceptible to diet-induced obesity and IR. The sister strains C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeOuJ come from a similar genetic lineage, and C3H/HeJ (but not C3H/HeOuJ) has a mutation in the endotoxin response gene Tlr4, which has been implicated as a critical regulator of fructose-induced steatosis. Age matched male mice (starting at 9 weeks of age) from the four common laboratory strains mentioned were fed either a 30% fructose (HFD) or a calorie-matched no fructose (NFD) diet for four weeks. HFD feeding resulted in significant weight gain increase only in the C3H substrains, primarily due to increased adiposity. Surprisingly, C57BL6/J was the only strain completely protected against diet-induced increase in body fat composition. Using 16S rDNA sequencing for microbiota composition analysis, we demonstrated that C57BL6/J is the only mouse strain that harbors the genus Akkermansia - previously demonstrated to have protective effects on obesity - along with a few other operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Also of interest, there was a wide range of variability across the four strains in serum cholesterol levels. In order to better understand the variability in the serum cholesterol and potential association with specific OTUs, we employed a generalized linear model with lasso shrinkage in order to identify influences of specific OTUs, and we established a robust relationship between the abundance of the genus Coprobacillaceae –both before, 2 weeks after, and 4 weeks after HFD or NFD feeding– and serum cholesterol. Correlations between this OTU and serum cholesterol have been observed in prior human and mouse studies from multiple groups. In response to the fructose diet, morphological examination of the distal jejunum reveals a dramatic increase in goblet cell secretion in C3H/HeOuJ, and a dramatic decrease in C3H/HeJ, possibly due to the lack of TLR4. In contrast, the goblet cell secretion of metabolically more stable strains A/J and C57BL6/J are unchanged. Our current studies are investigating potential links between the microbiota and intestinal and serum metabolites in promoting the observed phenotypic abnormalities. Possible future studies will aim to address the direction of causality in the associations presented here.&#xD;Support or Funding Information&#xD;A.S.G. receives support from R01 DK098606-02, T32 DK062032-24, and ARS agreement no. 58-1950-7-70</abstract><remote-database-name>www.fasebj.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.fasebj.org/content/30/1_Supplement/1166.2</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\Z6PDWHSN\Surujon et al. - 2016 - Crosstalk Between Host Genetics and Intestinal Mic.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-25 14:30:13</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walters, William</author><author>Hyde, Embriette R.</author><author>Berg-Lyons, Donna</author><author>Ackermann, Gail</author><author>Humphrey, Greg</author><author>Parada, Alma</author><author>Gilbert, Jack A.</author><author>Jansson, Janet K.</author><author>Caporaso, J.

Here, we examined the performance of modified 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers for archaea/bacteria and fungi, respectively, with nonaquatic samples. We moved primer bar codes to the 5′ end, allowing for a range of different 3′ primer pairings, such as the 515f/926r primer pair, which amplifies variable regions 4 and 5 of the 16S rRNA gene. We additionally demonstrated that modifications to the 515f/806r (variable region 4) 16S primer pair, which improves detection of Thaumarchaeota and clade SAR11 in marine samples, do not degrade performance on taxa already amplified effectively by the original primer set. Alterations to the fungal ITS primers did result in differential but overall improved performance compared to the original primers. In both cases, the improved primers should be widely adopted for amplicon studies.&#xD;IMPORTANCE We continue to uncover a wealth of information connecting microbes in important ways to human and environmental ecology. As our scientific knowledge and technical abilities improve, the tools used for microbiome surveys can be modified to improve the accuracy of our techniques, ensuring that we can continue to identify groundbreaking connections between microbes and the ecosystems they populate, from ice caps to the human body. It is important to confirm that modifications to these tools do not cause new, detrimental biases that would inhibit the field rather than continue to move it forward. We therefore demonstrated that two recently modified primer pairs that target taxonomically discriminatory regions of bacterial and fungal genomic DNA do not introduce new biases when used on a variety of sample types, from soil to human skin. This confirms the utility of these primers for maintaining currently recommended microbiome research techniques as the state of the art.</abstract><remote-database-name>msystems.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://msystems.asm.org/content/1/1/e00009-15</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\I3V759XZ\Walters et al. - 2016 - Improved Bacterial 16S rRNA Gene (V4 and V4-5) and.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\R4JXRMTP\Walters et al. - 2016 - Improved Bacterial 16S rRNA Gene (V4 and V4-5) and.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-07 19:20:04</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pesesky, Mitchell W.</author><author>Hussain, Tahir</author><author>Wallace, Meghan</author><author>Patel, Sanket</author><author>Andleeb, Saadia</author><author>Burnham, Carey-Ann D.</author><author>Dantas, Gautam</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of Machine Learning and Rules-Based Approaches for Predicting Antimicrobial Resistance Profiles in Gram-negative Bacilli from Whole Genome Sequence Data</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Front Microbiol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1887</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>resistance</keyword><keyword>aminoglycoside</keyword><keyword>antibiotics</keyword><keyword>beta-lactam</keyword><keyword>diagnostics</keyword><keyword>Enterobacteriaceae</keyword><keyword>machine-learning</keyword><keyword>tetracycline</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fmicb.2016.01887</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The time-to-result for culture-based microorganism recovery and phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing necessitates initial use of empiric (frequently broad-spectrum) antimicrobial therapy. If the empiric therapy is not optimal, this can lead to adverse patient outcomes and contribute to increasing antibiotic resistance in pathogens. New, more rapid technologies are emerging to meet this need. Many of these are based on identifying resistance genes, rather than directly assaying resistance phenotypes, and thus require interpretation to translate the genotype into treatment recommendations. These interpretations, like other parts of clinical diagnostic workflows, are likely to be increasingly automated in the future. We set out to evaluate the two major approaches that could be amenable to automation pipelines: rules-based methods and machine learning methods. The rules-based algorithm makes predictions based upon current, curated knowledge of Enterobacteriaceae resistance genes. The machine-learning algorithm predicts resistance and susceptibility based on a model built from a training set of variably resistant isolates. As our test set, we used whole genome sequence data from 78 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, previously identified to represent a variety of phenotypes, from fully-susceptible to pan-resistant strains for the antibiotics tested. We tested three antibiotic resistance determinant databases for their utility in identifying the complete resistome for each isolate. The predictions of the rules-based and machine learning algorithms for these isolates were compared to results of phenotype-based diagnostics. The rules based and machine-learning predictions achieved agreement with standard-of-care phenotypic diagnostics of 89.0 and 90.3%, respectively, across twelve antibiotic agents from six major antibiotic classes. Several sources of disagreement between the algorithms were identified. Novel variants of known resistance factors and incomplete genome assembly confounded the rules-based algorithm, resulting in predictions based on gene family, rather than on knowledge of the specific variant found. Low-frequency resistance caused errors in the machine-learning algorithm because those genes were not seen or seen infrequently in the test set. We also identified an example of variability in the phenotype-based results that led to disagreement with both genotype-based methods. Genotype-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing shows great promise as a diagnostic tool, and we outline specific research goals to further refine this methodology.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965630</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gordon, N.

However, its ability to provide accurate predictions has not yet been demonstrated in large independent studies of specific organisms. In this study, we aimed to develop a genotypic prediction method for antimicrobial susceptibilities. The whole genomes of 501 unrelated Staphylococcus aureus isolates were sequenced, and the assembled genomes were interrogated using BLASTn for a panel of known resistance determinants (chromosomal mutations and genes carried on plasmids). Results were compared with phenotypic susceptibility testing for 12 commonly used antimicrobial agents (penicillin, methicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, trimethoprim, gentamicin, fusidic acid, rifampin, and mupirocin) performed by the routine clinical laboratory. We investigated discrepancies by repeat susceptibility testing and manual inspection of the sequences and used this information to optimize the resistance determinant panel and BLASTn algorithm. We then tested performance of the optimized tool in an independent validation set of 491 unrelated isolates, with phenotypic results obtained in duplicate by automated broth dilution (BD Phoenix) and disc diffusion. In the validation set, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the genomic prediction method were 0.97 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.95 to 0.98) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1), respectively, compared to standard susceptibility testing methods. The very major error rate was 0.5%, and the major error rate was 0.7%. WGS was as sensitive and specific as routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods. WGS is a promising alternative to culture methods for resistance prediction in S. aureus and ultimately other major bacterial pathogens.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501024</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bradley, Phelim</author><author>Gordon, N.

Bacterial glycans are an attractive target for new treatments, as they are frequently linked to pathogenesis and contain distinctive structures that are absent in humans. We set out to develop a novel targeting strategy based on surface glycans present on the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori (Hp). In this study, metabolic labeling of bacterial glycans with an azide-containing sugar allowed selective delivery of immune stimulants to azide-covered Hp. We established that Hp's surface glycans are labeled by treatment with the metabolic substrate peracetylated N-azidoacetylglucosamine (Ac4GlcNAz). By contrast, mammalian cells treated with Ac4GlcNAz exhibited no incorporation of the chemical label within extracellular glycans. We further demonstrated that the Staudinger ligation between azides and phosphines proceeds under acidic conditions with only a small loss of efficiency. We then targeted azide-covered Hp with phosphines conjugated to the immune stimulant 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP), a compound capable of directing a host immune response against these cells. Finally, we report that immune effector cells catalyze selective damage in vitro to DNP-covered Hp in the presence of anti-DNP antibodies. The technology reported herein represents a novel strategy to target Hp based on its glycans.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbic.201300006/abstract</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\DIKRCJP2\Kaewsapsak et al. - 2013 - Recruiting the Host's Immune System to Target Heli.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\S48KCGHU\Kaewsapsak et al. - 2013 - Recruiting the Host's Immune System to Target Heli.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-06 16:34:03</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hathaway, Lucy J.</author><author>Bättig, Patrick</author><author>Reber, Sandra</author><author>Rotzetter, Jeannine U.</author><author>Aebi, Suzanne</author><author>Hauser, Christoph</author><author>Heller, Manfred</author><author>Kadioglu, Aras</author><author>Mühlemann, Kathrin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Streptococcus pneumoniae detects and responds to foreign bacterial peptide fragments in its environment</title><secondary-title>Open Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Open Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Open Biol</abbr-1></periodical><volume>4</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-4-9</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2046-2441</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rsob.130224</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important cause of bacterial meningitis and pneumonia but usually colonizes the human nasopharynx harmlessly. As this niche is simultaneously populated by other bacterial species, we looked for a role and pathway of communication between pneumococci and other species. This paper shows that two proteins of non-encapsulated S. pneumoniae, AliB-like ORF 1 and ORF 2, bind specifically to peptides matching other species resulting in changes in the pneumococci. AliB-like ORF 1 binds specifically peptide SETTFGRDFN, matching 50S ribosomal subunit protein L4 of Enterobacteriaceae, and facilitates upregulation of competence for genetic transformation. AliB-like ORF 2 binds specifically peptides containing sequence FPPQS, matching proteins of Prevotella species common in healthy human nasopharyngeal microbiota. We found that AliB-like ORF 2 mediates the early phase of nasopharyngeal colonization in vivo. The ability of S. pneumoniae to bind and respond to peptides of other bacterial species occupying the same host niche may play a key role in adaptation to its environment and in interspecies communication. These findings reveal a completely new concept of pneumococcal interspecies communication which may have implications for communication between other bacterial species and for future interventional therapeutics.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4043112/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TU94RSWH\Hathaway et al. - 2014 - Streptococcus pneumoniae detects and responds to f.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4043112/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-06 15:41:30</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krone, Cassandra L.</author><author>Biesbroek, Giske</author><author>Trzciński, Krzysztof</author><author>Sanders, Elisabeth A.

Thus far, animal models have been used to study the dynamics of and interactions between limited numbers of different species in the URT. Here, we applied a deep sequencing approach to explore, for the first time, the impact of S. pneumoniae acquisition on URT microbiota in a mouse model, as well as potential age-dependent effects. Young-adult and elderly mice were inoculated intranasally with S. pneumoniae, and nasal lavage samples were collected for up to 28 days postcolonization. Bacterial DNA extracted from lavage samples was subjected to barcoded pyrosequencing of the V5-to-V7 hypervariable region of the small-subunit rRNA gene. We observed highly diverse microbial profiles, with the presence overall of 15 phyla and approximately 645 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). We noted differences in the composition of microbiota between young and elderly mice, with a significantly higher abundance of Bacteroidetes in the young mice. The introduction of S. pneumoniae into the URT led to a temporary dominance of pneumococci in the microbiota of all mice, accompanied by a significant decrease in microbial diversity. As mice gradually cleared the colonization, the diversity returned to baseline levels. Diversification was accompanied by an early expansion of Bacteroidetes, Staphylococcus spp., and Lachnospiraceae. Moreover, the Bacteroidetes expansion was significantly greater in young-adult than in elderly mice. In conclusion, we observed differences in URT microbiota composition between naive young-adult and elderly mice that were associated with differences in pneumococcal clearance over time.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3993406/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SN7WUKX2\Krone et al. - 2014 - Respiratory Microbiota Dynamics following Streptoc.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3993406/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-06 15:41:28</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thevaranjan, Netusha</author><author>Whelan, Fiona J.</author><author>Puchta, Alicja</author><author>Ashu, Eta</author><author>Rossi, Laura</author><author>Surette, Michael G.</author><author>Bowdish, Dawn M.

Colonization is asymptomatic, involving dynamic and complex interplay between commensals, the host immune system, and environmental factors. The elderly are at an increased risk of developing pneumonia, which might be due to changes in the respiratory microbiota that would impact bacterial colonization and persistence within this niche. We hypothesized that the composition of the upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiota changes with age and subsequently can contribute to sustained colonization and inefficient clearance of S. pneumoniae. To test this, we used a mouse model of pneumococcal colonization to compare the composition of the URT microbiota in young, middle-aged, and old mice in the naive state and during the course of colonization using nasal pharyngeal washes. Sequencing of variable region 3 (V3) of the 16S rRNA gene was used to identify changes occurring with age and throughout the course of S. pneumoniae colonization. We discovered that age affects the composition of the URT microbiota and that colonization with S. pneumoniae is more disruptive of preexisting communities in older mice. We have further shown that host-pathogen interactions following S. pneumoniae colonization can impact the populations of resident microbes, including Staphylococcus and Haemophilus. Together, our findings indicate alterations to the URT microbiota could be detrimental to the elderly, resulting in increased colonization of S. pneumoniae and decreased efficiency in its clearance.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4807479/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\Q8S26H62\Thevaranjan et al. - 2016 - Streptococcus pneumoniae Colonization Disrupts the.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4807479/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-06 15:41:27</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sakwinska, Olga</author><author>Bastic Schmid, Viktoria</author><author>Berger, Bernard</author><author>Bruttin, Anne</author><author>Keitel, Kristina</author><author>Lepage, Mélissa</author><author>Moine, Deborah</author><author>Ngom Bru, Catherine</author><author>Brüssow, Harald</author><author>Gervaix, Alain</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nasopharyngeal Microbiota in Healthy Children and Pneumonia Patients</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>J Clin Microbiol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1590-1594</pages><volume>52</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-5</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0095-1137</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/JCM.03280-13</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Our study is the first to compare the nasopharyngeal microbiota of pediatric pneumonia patients and control children by 454 pyrosequencing.

However, how the specificity of such interactions may change over time and impact the evolution of both partners is still largely unexplored. In this work we examine four homologs of ribosomal protein S15 from diverse bacterial species. While S15 interacts with a conserved rRNA site, each S15 homolog regulates its own expression using a different mRNA structure. We measured the in vitro and regulatory interactions for all pairwise combinations between four S15 homologs and regulatory mRNA structures from diverse species. We find that each S15 homolog interacts with a different set of mRNA structures and their mutants. This work demonstrates that even highly conserved proteins such as S15 can have distinct RNA-binding repertoires that are likely the result of selection on both the mRNA and the protein sequence over time.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005720</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\IZA7G8TE\Slinger et al. - 2015 - Co-evolution of Bacterial Ribosomal Protein S15 wi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SRZ5N8B3\Slinger et al. - 2015 - Co-evolution of Bacterial Ribosomal Protein S15 wi.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-12-20 19:54:21</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Katsamba, Phinikoula S.</author><author>Park, Sungmin</author><author>Laird-Offringa, Ite A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Kinetic studies of RNA–protein interactions using surface plasmon resonance</title><secondary-title>Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Methods</full-title><abbr-1>Methods</abbr-1></periodical><pages>95-104</pages><volume>26</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>February 2002</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1046-2023</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S1046-2023(02)00012-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although structural, biochemical, and genetic studies have provided much insight into the determinants of specificity and affinity of proteins for RNA, little is currently known about the kinetics that underlie RNA–protein interactions. Protein–RNA complexes are dynamic, and the kinetics of binding and release could influence many processes, such as the ability of RNA–binding proteins to compete for binding sites, the sequential assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes, and the ability of bound RNA to move between cellular compartments. Therefore, to attain a complete and biologically relevant understanding of RNA–protein interactions, complex formation must be studied not only in equilibrated reactions, but also as a dynamic process. BIACORE, a surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor technology, allows intermolecular interactions to be measured in real time, and can provide both equilibrium and kinetic information about complex formation. This technology is a powerful tool with which to study the dynamics of RNA–protein interactions. We have used BIACORE extensively to obtain detailed insight into the interaction between RNA and proteins carrying RNA recognition motif domains. Here we discuss the physical principles on which BIACORE is based, and the required instrumentation. We describe how to design well-controlled RNA–protein interaction experiments aimed at yielding high-quality data, and outline the steps required for data analysis. In addition, we present examples to illustrate how kinetic studies have provided us with unique insights into the interaction of the spliceosomal U1A protein and the neuronal HuD protein with their respective RNA targets.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202302000129</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\4UTIKS8M\Katsamba et al. - 2002 - Kinetic studies of RNA–protein interactions using .html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-12-15 12:10:13</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vincent, Helen A.</author><author>Phillips, Jack O.</author><author>Henderson, Charlotte A.</author><author>Roberts, Adam J.</author><author>Stone, Carlanne M.</author><author>Mardle, Charlotte E.</author><author>Butt, Louise E.</author><author>Gowers, Darren M.</author><author>Pickford, Andrew R.</author><author>Callaghan, Anastasia J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Improved Method for Surface Immobilisation of RNA: Application to Small Non-Coding RNA - mRNA Pairing</title><secondary-title>PLOS ONE</secondary-title><short-title>An Improved Method for Surface Immobilisation of RNA</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS ONE</full-title><abbr-1>PLOS ONE</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e79142</pages><volume>8</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Messenger RNA</keyword><keyword>Adenine</keyword><keyword>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay</keyword><keyword>Ligases</keyword><keyword>RNA synthesis</keyword><keyword>RNA transcription labeling</keyword><keyword>Small interfering RNAs</keyword><keyword>Vibrio cholerae</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>Nov 14, 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0079142</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Characterisation of RNA and its intermolecular interactions is increasing in importance as the inventory of known RNA functions continues to expand. RNA-RNA interactions are central to post-transcriptional gene regulation mechanisms in bacteria, and the interactions of bacterial small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) with their mRNA targets are the subject of much current research. The technology of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is an attractive approach to studying these interactions since it is highly sensitive, and allows interaction measurements to be recorded in real-time. Whilst a number of approaches exist to label RNAs for surface-immobilisation, the method documented here is simple, quick, efficient, and utilises the high-affinity streptavidin-biotin interaction. Specifically, we ligate a biotinylated nucleotide to the 3′ end of RNA using T4 RNA ligase. Although this is a previously recognised approach, we have optimised the method by our discovery that the incorporation of four or more adenine nucleotides at the 3′ end of the RNA (a poly-A-tail) is required in order to achieve high ligation efficiencies. We use this method within the context of investigating small non-coding RNA (sRNA) - mRNA interactions through the application of surface technologies, including quantitative SPR assays. We first focus on validating the method using the recently characterised Escherichia coli sRNA-mRNA pair, MicA-ompA, specifically demonstrating that the addition of the poly-A-tail to either RNA does not affect its subsequent binding interactions with partner molecules.

The correct function of membrane proteins depends on spatiotemporal organization into defined membrane areas, called lipid domains or rafts. Lipid microdomains are therefore thought to assist compartmentalization of membranes. However, how lipid and protein assemblies are organized and whether proteins are actively involved in these processes remains poorly understood. We now have identified flotillins to be responsible for lateral segregation of defined membrane domains in the model organism Bacillus subtilis. We show that flotillins form large, dynamic assemblies that are able to influence membrane fluidity and prevent condensation of Laurdan stained membrane regions. Absence of flotillins in vivo leads to coalescence of distinct domains of high membrane order and, hence, loss of flotillins in the bacterial plasma-membrane reduces membrane heterogeneity. We show that flotillins interact with various proteins involved in protein secretion, cell wall metabolism, transport and membrane-related signalling processes. Importantly, maintenance of membrane heterogeneity is critical for vital cellular processes such as protein secretion.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mmi.12252/abstract</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\IVIHV9S5\Bach and Bramkamp - 2013 - Flotillins functionally organize the bacterial mem.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\A8EC5V5X\Bach and Bramkamp - 2013 - Flotillins functionally organize the bacterial mem.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-12-02 17:29:18</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Slinger, Betty L.</author><author>Deiorio-Haggar, Kaila</author><author>Anthony, Jon S.</author><author>Gilligan, Molly M.</author><author>Meyer, Michelle M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Discovery and validation of novel and distinct RNA regulators for ribosomal protein S15 in diverse bacterial phyla</title><secondary-title>BMC Genomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Genomics</full-title><abbr-1>BMC Genomics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>657</pages><volume>15</volume><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2164</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2164-15-657</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Autogenous cis-regulators of ribosomal protein synthesis play a critical role in maintaining the stoichiometry of ribosome components.

One such region is the str locus, containing the S10–spc–alpha operons. These operons contain genes coding for ribosomal proteins and for a number of housekeeping genes. We compared the organisation of these gene clusters in 111 sequenced prokaryotic genomes (99 bacterial and 12 archaeal genomes). We also compared the organisation to the phylogeny based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences and the sequences of the ribosomal proteins L22, L16 and S14. Our data indicate that there is much variation in gene order and content in these gene clusters, both in bacterial as well as in archaeal genomes. Our data indicate that differential gene loss has occurred on multiple occasions during evolution. We also noted several discrepancies between phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and sequences of ribosomal proteins L16, L22 and S14, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer did play a significant role in the evolution of the S10–spc–alpha gene clusters.</abstract><remote-database-name>femsle.oxfordjournals.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://femsle.oxfordjournals.org/content/242/1/117</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\5HK27PV6\Coenye and Vandamme - 2005 - Organisation of the S10, spc and alpha ribosomal p.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15621428</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\5F84SXUU\Coenye and Vandamme - 2005 - Organisation of the S10, spc and alpha ribosomal p.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-12-01 18:10:46</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Deiorio-Haggar, Kaila</author><author>Anthony, Jon</author><author>Meyer, Michelle M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RNA structures regulating ribosomal protein biosynthesis in bacilli</title><secondary-title>RNA Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>RNA Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>1180-1184</pages><volume>10</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Bacillus subtilis</keyword><keyword>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</keyword><keyword>gram-positive</keyword><keyword>Infernal</keyword><keyword>Rfam</keyword><keyword>ribosomal leader sequence</keyword><keyword>ribosomal protein</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>July 1, 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1547-6286</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4161/rna.24151</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In Bacilli, there are three experimentally validated ribosomal-protein autogenous regulatory RNAs that are not shared with E. coli.

Only one of these RNAs that interacts with L20 is currently found in the RNA Families Database. We created, or modified, existing structural alignments for these three RNAs and used them to perform homology searches. We have determined that each structure exhibits a narrow phylogenetic distribution, mostly relegated to the Firmicute class Bacilli.

We have found structural homology between the S7 binding region on 16S rRNA and a region of the mRNA where S7 acts as a translational repressor. Similarly, there is structural homology between one of the reported S4 binding regions on 16S rRNA and the mRNA target site for S4. The observed homology supports the concept that regulation by repressor r proteins is based on competition between rRNA and mRNA for these proteins and that the same structural features and of the r proteins are used in their interactions with both rRNA and mRNA.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC350445/</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC350445/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-12-01 17:36:26</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Slinger, Betty L.</author><author>Meyer, Michelle M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RNA regulators responding to ribosomal protein S15 are frequent in sequence space</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acids Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic Acids Research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucl.

One essential question regarding this phenomenon is whether such RNA regulators are the result of convergent or divergent evolution. Are the RNAs derived from some common ancestor and diverged to the point where we cannot identify the similarity, or have multiple solutions to the same biological problem arisen independently? A key variable in assessing these alternatives is how frequently such regulators arise within sequence space. Ribosomal protein S15 is autogenously regulated via an RNA regulator in many bacterial species; four apparently distinct regulators have been functionally validated in different bacterial phyla. Here, we explore how frequently such regulators arise within a partially randomized sequence population. We find many RNAs that interact specifically with ribosomal protein S15 from Geobacillus kaustophilus with biologically relevant dissociation constants. Furthermore, of the six sequences we characterize, four show regulatory activity in an Escherichia coli reporter assay. Subsequent footprinting and mutagenesis analysis indicates that protein binding proximal to regulatory features such as the Shine–Dalgarno sequence is sufficient to enable regulation, suggesting that regulation in response to S15 is relatively easily acquired.</abstract><remote-database-name>nar.oxfordjournals.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/19/9331</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/19/9331.full.pdf</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27580716</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SGX7FTHH\Slinger and Meyer - 2016 - RNA regulators responding to ribosomal protein S15.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-12-01 15:41:38</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Theimer, Carla A.</author><author>Finger, L.

Here we examine the effect of the DKC mutations on the structure and stability of human telomerase RNA pseudoknot and CR7 domains by using NMR and thermal melting. The CR7 domain point mutation decreases stability and alters a conserved secondary structure thought to be involved in human telomerase RNA accumulation in vivo. We find that pseudoknot constructs containing the conserved elements of the pseudoknot domain are in equilibrium with a hairpin conformation. The solution structure of the wild-type hairpin reveals that it forms a continuous helix containing a novel run of three consecutive U.U and a U.C base pairs closed by a pentaloop. The six base pairs unique to the hairpin conformation are phylogenetically conserved in mammals, suggesting that this conformation is also functionally important. The DKC mutation in the pseudoknot domain results in a shift in the equilibrium toward the hairpin form, primarily due to destabilization of the pseudoknot. Our results provide insight into the effect of these mutations on telomerase structure and suggest that the catalytic cycle of telomerase involves a delicate interplay between RNA conformational states, alteration of which leads to the disease state.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12525685</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holmstrom, Erik D.</author><author>Nesbitt, David J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Single-Molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Studies of the Human Telomerase RNA Pseudoknot: Temperature-/Urea-Dependent Folding Kinetics and Thermodynamics</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B</secondary-title><short-title>Single-Molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Studies of the Human Telomerase RNA Pseudoknot</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B</full-title><abbr-1>J.

The single RNA component of telomerase contains both the template sequence for DNA synthesis and a functionally critical pseudoknot motif, which can also exist as a less stable hairpin. Here we use a minimal version of the human telomerase RNA pseudoknot to study this hairpin–pseudoknot structural equilibrium using temperature-controlled single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments. The urea dependence of these experiments aids in determination of the folding kinetics and thermodynamics. The wild-type pseudoknot behavior is compared and contrasted to a mutant pseudoknot sequence implicated in a genetic disorder–dyskeratosis congenita. These findings clearly identify that this 2nt noncomplementary mutation destabilizes the folding of the wild-type pseudoknot by substantially reducing the folding rate constant (≈ 400-fold) while only nominally increasing the unfolding rate constant (≈ 5-fold). Furthermore, the urea dependence of the equilibrium and rate constants is used to develop a free energy landscape for this unimolecular equilibrium and propose details about the structure of the transition state. Finally, the urea-dependent folding experiments provide valuable physical insights into the mechanism for destabilization of RNA pseudoknots by such chemical denaturants.</abstract><remote-database-name>ACS Publications</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp501893c</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\VSXFSFK7\Holmstrom and Nesbitt - 2014 - Single-Molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Tran.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8ZSNC7W7\Holmstrom and Nesbitt - 2014 - Single-Molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Tran.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-10-09 21:03:12</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shelton, Valerie M.</author><author>Sosnick, Tobin R.</author><author>Pan, Tao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Applicability of Urea in the Thermodynamic Analysis of Secondary and Tertiary RNA Folding</title><secondary-title>Biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemistry</full-title><abbr-1>Biochemistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>16831-16839</pages><volume>38</volume><number>51</number><issue>51</issue><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>December 1, 1999</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0006-2960</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/bi991699s</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The equilibrium folding of a series of self-complementary RNA duplexes and the unmodified yeast tRNAPhe is studied as a function of urea and Mg2+ concentration with optical spectroscopies and chemical modification under isothermal conditions. Via application of standard methodologies from protein folding, the folding free energy and its dependence on urea concentration, the m value, are determined. The free energies of the RNA duplexes obtained from the urea titrations are in good agreement with those calculated from thermal melting studies [Freier, S. I., et al. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 9373]. The m value correlates with the length of the RNA duplex and is not sensitive to ionic conditions and temperature. The folding of the unmodified yeast tRNAPhe can be described by two Mg2+-dependent transitions, the second of which corresponds to the formation of the native tertiary structure as confirmed by hydroxyl radical protection and partial nuclease digestion. Both transitions are sensitive to urea and have m values of 0.94 and 1.70 kcal mol-1 M-1, respectively. Although the precise chemical basis of urea denaturation of RNA is uncertain, the m values for the duplexes and tRNAPhe are proportional to the amount of the surface area buried in the folding transition. This proportionality, 0.099 cal mol-1 M-1 Å-2, is very similar to that observed for proteins, 0.11 cal mol-1 M-1 Å-2 [Myers, J., Pace, N., and Scholtz, M. (1995) Protein Sci. 4, 2138]. These results indicate that urea titration can be used to measure both the free energy and the magnitude of an RNA folding transition.</abstract><remote-database-name>ACS Publications</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi991699s</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\E433HPRI\Shelton et al. - 1999 - Applicability of Urea in the Thermodynamic Analysi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8UB8B4KJ\Shelton et al. - 1999 - Applicability of Urea in the Thermodynamic Analysi.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-10-09 20:48:42</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klostermeier, Dagmar</author><author>Hammann, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RNA Structure and Folding: Biophysical Techniques and Prediction Methods</title><short-title>RNA Structure and Folding</short-title></titles><pages>432</pages><keywords><keyword>Science / Life Sciences / Biochemistry</keyword><keyword>Science / Life Sciences / Biophysics</keyword><keyword>Science / Life Sciences / Molecular Biology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-10-14</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Walter de Gruyter</publisher><isbn>978-3-11-028495-9</isbn><abstract>While structure-function relationships of proteins have been studied for a long time, structural studies of RNA face additional challenges.

The accuracy of predictions made by free energy minimization is limited by the quality of the energy parameters in the underlying free energy model. The most widely used model, the Turner99 model, has hundreds of parameters, and so a robust parameter estimation scheme should efficiently handle large data sets with thousands of structures. Moreover, the estimation scheme should also be trained using available experimental free energy data in addition to structural data.&#xD;Results: In this work, we present constraint generation (CG), the first computational approach to RNA free energy parameter estimation that can be efficiently trained on large sets of structural as well as thermodynamic data. Our CG approach employs a novel iterative scheme, whereby the energy values are first computed as the solution to a constrained optimization problem. Then the newly computed energy parameters are used to update the constraints on the optimization function, so as to better optimize the energy parameters in the next iteration. Using our method on biologically sound data, we obtain revised parameters for the Turner99 energy model. We show that by using our new parameters, we obtain significant improvements in prediction accuracy over current state of-the-art methods.&#xD;Availability: Our CG implementation is available at http://www.rnasoft.ca/CG/&#xD;Contact: andrones@cs.ubc.ca</abstract><remote-database-name>bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/13/i19</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\B5S6S2SV\Andronescu et al. - 2007 - Efficient parameter estimation for RNA secondary s.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17646296</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8XAIWBBT\Andronescu et al. - 2007 - Efficient parameter estimation for RNA secondary s.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-10-06 03:19:17</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stofer, E.</author><author>Chipot, C.</author><author>Lavery, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Free Energy Calculations of Watson−Crick Base Pairing in Aqueous Solution</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Chemical Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Chemical Society</full-title><abbr-1>J.

The genomes of 44 diverse strains of S. pneumoniae were analyzed and compared with strains of non-pathogenic streptococci of the Mitis group.&#xD;RESULTS: Despite evidence of extensive recombination, the S. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree revealed six major lineages. With the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site of isolation and disease outcome. The distribution of dispensable genes--genes present in more than one strain but not in all strains--was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. Homologous recombination, involving short stretches of DNA, was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of S. pneumoniae. Genetic exchange occurred both within and across the borders of the species, and S. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of S. pneumoniae. The pan-genome size of S. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the number of polymorphic sites of the sampled genomes, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age of clones. Most genes associated with pathogenicity were shared by all S. pneumoniae strains, but were also present in S. mitis, S. oralis and S. infantis, indicating that these genes are not sufficient to determine virulence.&#xD;CONCLUSIONS: Genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche is the main mechanism of evolution of S. pneumoniae. The open pan-genome guarantees the species a quick and economical response to diverse environments.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21034474</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Connor, Annalouise</author><author>Quizon, Pamela M.</author><author>Albright, Jody E.</author><author>Lin, Fred T.</author><author>Bennett, Brian J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Responsiveness of cardiometabolic-related microbiota to diet is influenced by host genetics</title><secondary-title>Mammalian Genome: Official Journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mammalian Genome: Official Journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society</full-title><abbr-1>Mamm.

In comparison with environmental influences, the effect of host genetics on intestinal microbiota, and how host-driven differences alter host metabolism is unclear. Additionally, the interaction between host genetics and diet, and the impact on the intestinal microbiome and possible down-stream effect on host metabolism is not fully understood, but represents another aspects of inter-individual variation in disease risk. The objectives of this study were to investigate how diet and genetic background shape microbial communities, and how these diet- and genetic-driven microbial differences relate to cardiometabolic phenotypes. To determine these effects, we used the 8 progenitor strains of the collaborative cross/diversity outbred mapping panels (C57BL/6J, A/J, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILtJ, WSB/EiJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and 129S1/SvImJ). 16s rRNA profiling of enteric microbial communities in addition to the assessment of phenotypes central to cardiometabolic health was conducted under baseline nutritional conditions and in response to diets varying in atherogenic nutrient (fat, cholesterol, cholic acid) composition. These studies revealed strain-driven differences in enteric microbial communities which were retained with dietary intervention. Diet-strain interactions were seen for a core group of cardiometabolic-related microbial taxa. In conclusion, these studies highlight diet and genetically regulated cardiometabolic-related microbial taxa. Furthermore, we demonstrate the progenitor model is useful for nutrigenomic-based studies and screens seeking to investigate the interaction between genetic background and the phenotypic and microbial response to diet.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25159725</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Koren, Omry</author><author>Spor, Aymé</author><author>Felin, Jenny</author><author>Fåk, Frida</author><author>Stombaugh, Jesse</author><author>Tremaroli, Valentina</author><author>Behre, Carl Johan</author><author>Knight, Rob</author><author>Fagerberg, Björn</author><author>Ley, Ruth E.</author><author>Bäckhed, Fredrik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human oral, gut, and plaque microbiota in patients with atherosclerosis</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>Proc.

Furthermore, the gut microbiota may affect obesity, which is associated with atherosclerosis. Using qPCR, we show that bacterial DNA was present in the atherosclerotic plaque and that the amount of DNA correlated with the amount of leukocytes in the atherosclerotic plaque. To investigate the microbial composition of atherosclerotic plaques and test the hypothesis that the oral or gut microbiota may contribute to atherosclerosis in humans, we used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes to survey the bacterial diversity of atherosclerotic plaque, oral, and gut samples of 15 patients with atherosclerosis, and oral and gut samples of healthy controls. We identified Chryseomonas in all atherosclerotic plaque samples, and Veillonella and Streptococcus in the majority. Interestingly, the combined abundances of Veillonella and Streptococcus in atherosclerotic plaques correlated with their abundance in the oral cavity. Moreover, several additional bacterial phylotypes were common to the atherosclerotic plaque and oral or gut samples within the same individual. Interestingly, several bacterial taxa in the oral cavity and the gut correlated with plasma cholesterol levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that bacteria from the oral cavity, and perhaps even the gut, may correlate with disease markers of atherosclerosis.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20937873</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hastie, Trevor</author><author>Tibshirani, Robert</author><author>Friedman, Jerome</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition</title><short-title>The Elements of Statistical Learning</short-title></titles><pages>757</pages><keywords><keyword>Computers / Bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>Computers / Databases / Data Mining</keyword><keyword>Computers / Intelligence (AI) &amp; Semantics</keyword><keyword>Computers / Machine Theory</keyword><keyword>Mathematics / Probability &amp; Statistics / General</keyword><keyword>Philosophy / Logic</keyword><keyword>Social Science / Future Studies</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-08-26</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Springer Science &amp; Business Media</publisher><isbn>978-0-387-84858-7</isbn><abstract>During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book&amp;#39;s coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression &amp;amp; path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide&amp;#39;&amp;#39; data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.</abstract><remote-database-name>Google Books</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><text-urls><url>https://books.google.com/books?id=tVIjmNS3Ob8C</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Blog">56</ref-type><titles><title>EMP Protocols and Standards : Earth Microbiome Project</title><short-title>EMP Protocols and Standards</short-title></titles><dates/><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols/</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\HMIISTBS\EMP Protocols and Standards  Earth Microbiome Pro.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-03-07 22:46:58</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Caporaso, J.

The mechanism by which HFD promotes adiposity is complex but thought to involve low-grade inflammation and altered gut microbiota. The goal of this study was to investigate the extent to which HFD-induced adiposity is driven by fat content vs. other factors that differentiate HFD vs. NCD. Mice were fed NCD, HFD, or other compositionally defined diets (CDD), designed to mimic NCD and/or explore the role of HFD components. A range of metabolic parameters reflecting low-grade inflammation and adiposity were assayed. Relative to NCD, HFD, and to a lesser, but, nonetheless, significant extent, CDD induced increased adiposity, indicating both lipid content and other aspects of HFD are obesogenic. Moreover, HFD and CDD induced a rapid and marked loss of cecal and colonic mass. Such CDD-induced effects were not affected by adjusting dietary protein levels/types but could be largely eliminated by exchanging insoluble fiber (cellulose) for soluble fiber (inulin). Replacing cellulose with inulin in HFD also protected mice against decreased intestinal mass, hyperphagia, and increased adiposity. Such beneficial effects of inulin were microbiota dependent, correlated with elevated fecal short-chain fatty acid levels analyzed via 1H-NMR-based metabolomics and were partially recapitulated by administration of short-chain fatty acid. HFD-induced obesity is strongly promoted by its lack of soluble fiber, which supports microbiota-mediated intestinal tissue homeostasis that prevents inflammation driving obesity and metabolic syndrome.</abstract><remote-database-name>ajpgi.physiology.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ajpgi.physiology.org/content/309/7/G528</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SXKHT2JD\Chassaing et al. - 2015 - Lack of soluble fiber drives diet-induced adiposit.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26185332</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\FKWNQA43\Chassaing et al. - 2015 - Lack of soluble fiber drives diet-induced adiposit.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-02-29 16:48:46</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McDonald, Daniel</author><author>Price, Morgan N</author><author>Goodrich, Julia</author><author>Nawrocki, Eric P</author><author>DeSantis, Todd Z</author><author>Probst, Alexander</author><author>Andersen, Gary L</author><author>Knight, Rob</author><author>Hugenholtz, Philip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An improved Greengenes taxonomy with explicit ranks for ecological and evolutionary analyses of bacteria and archaea</title><secondary-title>The ISME Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The ISME Journal</full-title><abbr-1>ISME J</abbr-1></periodical><pages>610-618</pages><volume>6</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1751-7362</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ismej.2011.139</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reference phylogenies are crucial for providing a taxonomic framework for interpretation of marker gene and metagenomic surveys, which continue to reveal novel species at a remarkable rate. Greengenes is a dedicated full-length 16S rRNA gene database that provides users with a curated taxonomy based on de novo tree inference. We developed a ‘taxonomy to tree' approach for transferring group names from an existing taxonomy to a tree topology, and used it to apply the Greengenes, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and cyanoDB (Cyanobacteria only) taxonomies to a de novo tree comprising 408 315 sequences. We also incorporated explicit rank information provided by the NCBI taxonomy to group names (by prefixing rank designations) for better user orientation and classification consistency. The resulting merged taxonomy improved the classification of 75% of the sequences by one or more ranks relative to the original NCBI taxonomy with the most pronounced improvements occurring in under-classified environmental sequences. We also assessed candidate phyla (divisions) currently defined by NCBI and present recommendations for consolidation of 34 redundantly named groups. All intermediate results from the pipeline, which includes tree inference, jackknifing and transfer of a donor taxonomy to a recipient tree (tax2tree) are available for download. The improved Greengenes taxonomy should provide important infrastructure for a wide range of megasequencing projects studying ecosystems on scales ranging from our own bodies (the Human Microbiome Project) to the entire planet (the Earth Microbiome Project). The implementation of the software can be obtained from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tax2tree/.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3280142/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\4QUSZD93\McDonald et al. - 2012 - An improved Greengenes taxonomy with explicit rank.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3280142/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-02-22 15:20:29</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Xuehong</author><author>Dawson, David C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Potentiators Protect G551D but Not ΔF508 CFTR from Thermal Instability</title><secondary-title>Biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemistry</full-title><abbr-1>Biochemistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>5613-5618</pages><volume>53</volume><number>35</number><issue>35</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>September 9, 2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0006-2960</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/bi501007v</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The G551D cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation is associated with severe disease in ?5% of cystic fibrosis patients worldwide. This amino acid substitution in NBD1 results in a CFTR chloride channel characterized by a severe gating defect that can be at least partially overcome in vitro by exposure to a CFTR potentiator. In contrast, the more common ?F508 mutation is associated with a severe protein trafficking defect, as well as impaired channel function. Recent clinical trials demonstrated a beneficial effect of the CFTR potentiator, Ivacaftor (VX-770), on lung function of patients bearing at least one copy of G551D CFTR, but no comparable effect on ?F508 homozygotes. This difference in efficacy was not surprising in view of the established difference in the molecular phenotypes of the two mutant channels. Recently, however, it was shown that the structural defect introduced by the deletion of F508 is associated with the thermal instability of ?F508 CFTR channel function in vitro. This additional mutant phenotype raised the possibility that the differences in the behavior of ?F508 and G551D CFTR, as well as the disparate efficacy of Ivacaftor, might be a reflection of the differing thermal stabilities of the two channels at 37 °C. We compared the thermal stability of G551D and ?F508 CFTR in Xenopus oocytes in the presence and absence of CTFR potentiators. G551D CFTR exhibited a thermal instability that was comparable to that of ?F508 CFTR. G551D CFTR, however, was protected from thermal instability by CFTR potentiators, whereas ?F508 CFTR was not. These results suggest that the efficacy of VX-770 in patients bearing the G551D mutation is due, at least in part, to the ability of the small molecule to protect the mutant channel from thermal instability at human body temperature.</abstract><remote-database-name>ACS Publications</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi501007v</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\CE9PX5N4\Liu and Dawson - 2014 - Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulato.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6VMA68SQ\Liu and Dawson - 2014 - Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulato.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-02-21 22:29:29</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yueqiang Zhang</author><author>O'Brien III, William G.</author><author>Zhaoyang Zhao</author><author>Cheng Chi Lee</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>5'-adenosine monophosphate mediated cooling treatment enhances ΔF508-Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) stability in vivo</title><secondary-title>Journal of Biomedical Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Biomedical Science</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Biomedical Science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>22</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>ADENYLIC acid</keyword><keyword>CELLULAR signal transduction</keyword><keyword>Cystic Fibrosis</keyword><keyword>CYSTIC fibrosis -- Treatment</keyword><keyword>CYSTIC fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator</keyword><keyword>Genetic disorder</keyword><keyword>Hypometabolism</keyword><keyword>Hypothermia</keyword><keyword>Misfolded protein</keyword><keyword>Mutant</keyword><keyword>PHENYLALANINE</keyword><keyword>Rescue</keyword><keyword>Temperature-sensitive</keyword><keyword>Treatment</keyword><keyword>Whole body cooling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>September 3, 2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>10217770</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12929-015-0178-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Gene mutations that produce misprocessed proteins are linked to many human disorders. Interestingly, some misprocessed proteins retained their biological function when stabilized by low temperature treatment of cultured cells in vitro. Here we investigate whether low temperature treatment in vivo can rescue misfolded proteins by applying 5'-AMP mediated whole body cooling to a Cystic Fibrosis (CF) mouse model carrying a mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) with a deletion of the phenylalanine residue in position 508 (ΔF508-CFTR). Low temperature treatment of cultured cells was previously shown to be able to alleviate the processing defect of ΔF508-CFTR, enhancing its plasma membrane localization and its function in mediating chloride ion transport. Results: Here, we report that whole body cooling enhanced the retention of ΔF508-CFTR in intestinal epithelial cells. Functional analysis based on β-adrenergic dependent salivary secretion and post-natal mortality rate revealed a moderate but significant improvement in treated compared with untreated CF mice. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that temperature sensitive processing of mutant proteins can be responsive to low temperature treatment in vivo.</abstract><remote-database-name>EBSCOhost</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=109505099&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\7AVPX24N\Yueqiang Zhang et al. - 2015 - 5'-adenosine monophosphate mediated cooling treatm.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2016-02-20 21:39:20</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lim, Jung Sub</author><author>Mietus-Snyder, Michele</author><author>Valente, Annie</author><author>Schwarz, Jean-Marc</author><author>Lustig, Robert H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of fructose in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Gastroenterology and Hepatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Gastroenterology and Hepatology</full-title><abbr-1>Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>251-264</pages><volume>7</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>May 2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1759-5045</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrgastro.2010.41</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most frequent liver disease worldwide, and is commonly associated with the metabolic syndrome. Secular trends in the prevalence of these diseases may be associated with the increased fructose consumption observed in the Western diet. NAFLD is characterized by two steps of liver injury: intrahepatic lipid accumulation (hepatic steatosis), and inflammatory progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (the 'two-hit' theory). In the first 'hit', hepatic metabolism of fructose promotes de novo lipogenesis and intrahepatic lipid, inhibition of mitochondrial β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, triglyceride formation and steatosis, hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia. In the second 'hit', owing to the molecular instability of its five-membered furanose ring, fructose promotes protein fructosylation and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which require quenching by hepatic antioxidants. Many patients with NASH also have micronutrient deficiencies and do not have enough antioxidant capacity to prevent synthesis of ROS, resulting in necroinflammation. We postulate that excessive dietary fructose consumption may underlie the development of NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, we postulate that NAFLD and alcoholic fatty liver disease share the same pathogenesis.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/nrgastro/journal/v7/n5/full/nrgastro.2010.41.html</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-02-19 18:35:10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Koonen, Debby P.

Since aberrant hepatic fatty acid uptake may contribute to this, we investigated whether increased expression of a fatty acid transport protein (CD36) in the liver during DIO contributes to the dyslipidemia that precedes development of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We determined the effect DIO has on hepatic CD36 protein expression and the functional consequence of this in terms of hepatic triglyceride storage and secretion. In addition, in vivo adenoviral gene delivery of CD36 to the livers of lean mice was performed to determine if increased hepatic CD36 protein was sufficient to alter hepatic fatty acid uptake and triglyceride storage and secretion.&#xD;RESULTS—During DIO, CD36 protein levels in the liver are significantly elevated, and these elevated levels correlate with increased hepatic triglyceride storage and secretion. These alterations in liver lipid storage and secretion were also observed upon forced expression of hepatic CD36 in the absence of DIO and were accompanied with a marked rise in hepatic fatty acid uptake in vivo, demonstrating that increased CD36 expression is sufficient to recapitulate the aberrant liver lipid handling observed in DIO.&#xD;CONCLUSIONS—Increased expression of hepatic CD36 protein in response to DIO is sufficient to exacerbate hepatic triglyceride storage and secretion. As these CD36-mediated effects contribute to the dyslipidemia that often precedes the development of type 2 diabetes, increased hepatic CD36 expression likely plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.</abstract><remote-database-name>diabetes.diabetesjournals.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/56/12/2863</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\WKCNZW4V\Koonen et al. - 2007 - Increased Hepatic CD36 Expression Contributes to D.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17728375</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\RK57UQNA\Koonen et al. - 2007 - Increased Hepatic CD36 Expression Contributes to D.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-02-18 22:49:31</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>He, Jinhan</author><author>Lee, Jung Hoon</author><author>Febbraio, Maria</author><author>Xie, Wen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The emerging roles of fatty acid translocase/CD36 and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in fatty liver disease</title><secondary-title>Experimental Biology and Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Experimental Biology and Medicine</full-title><abbr-1>Exp Biol Med (Maywood)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1116-1121</pages><volume>236</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>aryl hydrocarbon receptor</keyword><keyword>CD36</keyword><keyword>gene regulation</keyword><keyword>nuclear receptor</keyword><keyword>steatosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>10/01/2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1535-3702, 1535-3699</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1258/ebm.2011.011128</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36 belongs to the class B scavenger receptor family. In addition to the known functions of CD36 in the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein by macrophages and uptake of fatty acids by adipose tissues, skeletal muscle and heart, emerging evidence has pointed to an equally important function of CD36 in the uptake of fatty acids in the liver and the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease. Recent reports have also suggested CD36 as a shared transcriptional target of several ligand-sensing and lipogenic transcriptional factors, such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and several nuclear hormone receptors, such as pregnane X receptor, liver X receptor and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is common and medically significant, because it is closely related to metabolic syndrome and has a potential to progress into the more harmful non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. It is hoped that CD36 and their transcriptional regulators can represent novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and management of fatty liver disease.</abstract><remote-database-name>ebm.sagepub.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ebm.sagepub.com/content/236/10/1116</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\MFTI58IQ\He et al. - 2011 - The emerging roles of fatty acid translocaseCD36 .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21885479</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\UKTPMDUI\He et al. - 2011 - The emerging roles of fatty acid translocaseCD36 .html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-02-18 22:40:57</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>What is Plagiarism?</title><secondary-title>Plagiarism.org - Best Practices for Ensuring Originality in Written Work</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plagiarism.org - Best Practices for Ensuring Originality in Written Work</full-title></periodical><dates/><abstract>Many people think of plagiarism as copying another's work or borrowing &#xD;someone else's original ideas.

DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 is a major enzyme that determines genomic methylation patterns. In order to understand the significance of mutations of the DNMT1 gene during human carcinogenesis, we performed polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis using 46 oligonucleotide primer sets for all 40 coding exons and the 5'-flanking region (450 bp) of the DNMT1 gene in 29 colorectal cancers, 32 stomach cancers, 40 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and a corresponding sample of non-cancerous tissue from each case. Mutations in coding exons of the DNMT1 gene were detected in two (7%) of the colorectal cancers: they consisted of one-base deletion resulting in deletion of the whole catalytic domain and a point mutation resulting in a single amino acid substitution. No stomach cancers or HCCs showed mutations in the coding exons of the DNMT1 gene. No mutation in the 5'-flanking region of the DNMT1 gene was detected in any of the colorectal and stomach cancers or HCCs. These data suggest that mutational inactivation of the DNMT1 gene that potentially causes a genome-wide alteration of DNA methylation status may be a rare event during human carcinogenesis.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637155</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oslizlo, Anna</author><author>Stefanic, Polonca</author><author>Dogsa, Iztok</author><author>Mandic-Mulec, Ines</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Private link between signal and response in Bacillus subtilis quorum sensing</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>PNAS</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1586-1591</pages><volume>111</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>social evolution</keyword><keyword>social interactions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>01/28/2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424, 1091-6490</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1316283111</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Bacteria coordinate their behavior using quorum sensing (QS), whereby cells secrete diffusible signals that generate phenotypic responses associated with group living. The canonical model of QS is one of extracellular signaling, where signal molecules bind to cognate receptors and cause a coordinated response across many cells. Here we study the link between QS input (signaling) and QS output (response) in the ComQXPA QS system of Bacillus subtilis by characterizing the phenotype and fitness of comQ null mutants. These lack the enzyme to produce the ComX signal and do not activate the ComQXPA QS system in other cells. In addition to the activation effect of the signal, however, we find evidence of a second, repressive effect of signal production on the QS system. Unlike activation, which can affect other cells, repression acts privately: the de-repression of QS in comQ cells is intracellular and only affects mutant cells lacking ComQ. As a result, the QS signal mutants have an overly responsive QS system and overproduce the secondary metabolite surfactin in the presence of the signal. This surfactin overproduction is associated with a strong fitness cost, as resources are diverted away from primary metabolism. Therefore, by acting as a private QS repressor, ComQ may be protected against evolutionary competition from loss-of-function mutations. Additionally, we find that surfactin participates in a social selection mechanism that targets signal null mutants in coculture with signal producers. Our study shows that by pleiotropically combining intracellular and extracellular signaling, bacteria may generate evolutionarily stable QS systems.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/111/4/1586</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\HVTTZU42\Oslizlo et al. - 2014 - Private link between signal and response in Bacill.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24425772</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\Q26FTAKK\Oslizlo et al. - 2014 - Private link between signal and response in Bacill.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-12-01 12:51:28</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, M.

Quorum sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules called autoinducers that increase in concentration as a function of cell density. The detection of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of an autoinducer leads to an alteration in gene expression. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing communication circuits to regulate a diverse array of physiological activities. These processes include symbiosis, virulence, competence, conjugation, antibiotic production, motility, sporulation, and biofilm formation. In general, Gram-negative bacteria use acylated homoserine lactones as autoinducers, and Gram-positive bacteria use processed oligo-peptides to communicate. Recent advances in the field indicate that cell-cell communication via autoinducers occurs both within and between bacterial species. Furthermore, there is mounting data suggesting that bacterial autoinducers elicit specific responses from host organisms. Although the nature of the chemical signals, the signal relay mechanisms, and the target genes controlled by bacterial quorum sensing systems differ, in every case the ability to communicate with one another allows bacteria to coordinate the gene expression, and therefore the behavior, of the entire community. Presumably, this process bestows upon bacteria some of the qualities of higher organisms. The evolution of quorum sensing systems in bacteria could, therefore, have been one of the early steps in the development of multicellularity.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11544353</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wijnen, Wino J.</author><author>van der Made, Ingeborg</author><author>van den Oever, Stephanie</author><author>Hiller, Monika</author><author>de Boer, Bouke A.</author><author>Picavet, Daisy I.</author><author>Chatzispyrou, Iliana A.</author><author>Houtkooper, Riekelt H.</author><author>Tijsen, Anke J.</author><author>Hagoort, Jaco</author><author>van Veen, Henk</author><author>Everts, Vincent</author><author>Ruijter, Jan M.</author><author>Pinto, Yigal M.</author><author>Creemers, Esther E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cardiomyocyte-Specific miRNA-30c Over-Expression Causes Dilated Cardiomyopathy</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title><abbr-1>PLoS One</abbr-1></periodical><volume>9</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-5-2</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0096290</electronic-resource-num><abstract>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate many aspects of cellular function and their deregulation has been implicated in heart disease. MiRNA-30c is differentially expressed in the heart during the progression towards heart failure and in vitro studies hint to its importance in cellular physiology. As little is known about the in vivo function of miRNA-30c in the heart, we generated transgenic mice that specifically overexpress miRNA-30c in cardiomyocytes. We show that these mice display no abnormalities until about 6 weeks of age, but subsequently develop a severely dilated cardiomyopathy. Gene expression analysis of the miRNA-30c transgenic hearts before onset of the phenotype indicated disturbed mitochondrial function. This was further evident by the downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes III and IV at the protein level. Taken together these data indicate impaired mitochondrial function due to OXPHOS protein depletion as a potential cause for the observed dilated cardiomyopathic phenotype in miRNA-30c transgenic mice. We thus establish an in vivo role for miRNA-30c in cardiac physiology, particularly in mitochondrial function.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008570/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\E9GXZF48\Wijnen et al. - 2014 - Cardiomyocyte-Specific miRNA-30c Over-Expression C.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008570/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-11-24 21:53:24</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Platt, Randall J.</author><author>Chen, Sidi</author><author>Zhou, Yang</author><author>Yim, Michael J.</author><author>Swiech, Lukasz</author><author>Kempton, Hannah R.</author><author>Dahlman, James E.</author><author>Parnas, Oren</author><author>Eisenhaure, Thomas M.</author><author>Jovanovic, Marko</author><author>Graham, Daniel B.</author><author>Jhunjhunwala, Siddharth</author><author>Heidenreich, Matthias</author><author>Xavier, Ramnik J.</author><author>Langer, Robert</author><author>Anderson, Daniel G.</author><author>Hacohen, Nir</author><author>Regev, Aviv</author><author>Feng, Guoping</author><author>Sharp, Phillip A.</author><author>Zhang, Feng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CRISPR-Cas9 Knockin Mice for Genome Editing and Cancer Modeling</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><pages>440-455</pages><volume>159</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>09/10/2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0092-8674</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.014</electronic-resource-num><abstract>CRISPR-Cas9 is a versatile genome editing technology for studying the functions of genetic elements. To broadly enable the application of Cas9 in vivo, we established a Cre-dependent Cas9 knockin mouse. We demonstrated in vivo as well as ex vivo genome editing using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-, lentivirus-, or particle-mediated delivery of guide RNA in neurons, immune cells, and endothelial cells. Using these mice, we simultaneously modeled the dynamics of KRAS, p53, and LKB1, the top three significantly mutated genes in lung adenocarcinoma. Delivery of a single AAV vector in the lung generated loss-of-function mutations in p53 and Lkb1, as well as homology-directed repair-mediated KrasG12D mutations, leading to macroscopic tumors of adenocarcinoma pathology. Together, these results suggest that Cas9 mice empower a wide range of biological and disease modeling applications.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.cell.com</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cell.com/article/S0092867414011635/abstract</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\EK6U5FNZ\Platt et al. - 2014 - CRISPR-Cas9 Knockin Mice for Genome Editing and Ca.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25263330</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\H5RXMP7P\Platt et al. - 2014 - CRISPR-Cas9 Knockin Mice for Genome Editing and Ca.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-11-20 11:41:10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Zixi</author><author>Wu, Yaling</author><author>Li, Lanfen</author><author>Su, Xiao-Dong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intermolecular recognition revealed by the complex structure of human CLOCK-BMAL1 basic helix-loop-helix domains with E-box DNA</title><secondary-title>Cell Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Research</full-title><abbr-1>Cell Res</abbr-1></periodical><pages>213-224</pages><volume>23</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>crystal structure</keyword><keyword>BMAL1</keyword><keyword>circadian</keyword><keyword>CLOCK</keyword><keyword>non-canonical E-box</keyword><keyword>phosphorylation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>February 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1001-0602</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/cr.2012.170</electronic-resource-num><abstract>CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) and BMAL1 (brain and muscle ARNT-like 1) are both transcription factors of the circadian core loop in mammals. Recently published mouse CLOCK-BMAL1 bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix)-PAS (period-ARNT-single-minded) complex structure sheds light on the mechanism for heterodimer formation, but the structural details of the protein-DNA recognition mechanisms remain elusive. Here we have elucidated the crystal structure of human CLOCK-BMAL1 bHLH domains bound to a canonical E-box DNA. We demonstrate that CLOCK and BMAL1 bHLH domains can be mutually selected, and that hydrogen-bonding networks mediate their E-box recognition. We identified a hydrophobic contact between BMAL1 Ile80 and a flanking thymine nucleotide, suggesting that CLOCK-BMAL1 actually reads 7-bp DNA and not the previously believed 6-bp DNA. To find potential non-canonical E-boxes that could be recognized by CLOCK-BMAL1, we constructed systematic single-nucleotide mutations on the E-box and measured their relevant affinities. We defined two non-canonical E-box patterns with high affinities, AACGTGA and CATGTGA, in which the flanking A7-T7′ base pair is indispensable for recognition. These results will help us to identify functional CLOCK-BMAL1-binding sites in vivo and to search for clock-controlled genes. Furthermore, we assessed the inhibitory role of potential phosphorylation sites in bHLH regions. We found that the phospho-mimicking mutation on BMAL1 Ser78 could efficiently block DNA binding as well as abolish normal circadian oscillation in cells. We propose that BMAL1 Ser78 should be a key residue mediating input signal-regulated transcriptional inhibition for external cues to entrain the circadian clock by kinase cascade.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/cr/journal/v23/n2/full/cr2012170a.html</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\87VWCDR3\Wang et al. - 2013 - Intermolecular recognition revealed by the complex.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NNCQ6JRR\Wang et al. - 2013 - Intermolecular recognition revealed by the complex.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-11-17 14:30:19</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Encyclopedia">53</ref-type><titles><title>Leucine zipper</title><secondary-title>Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015-09-02T10:44:25Z</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>A leucine zipper, aka leucine scissors, is a common three-dimensional structural motif in proteins. They were first described by Landschulz and collaborators in 1988  when they found that an enhancer binding protein had a very characteristic 30-amino acid segment and the display of these amino acid sequences on an idealized alpha helix revealed a periodic repetition of leucine residues at every seventh position over a distance covering eight helical turns. The polypeptide segments containing these periodic arrays of leucine residues were proposed to exist in an alpha-helical conformation and the leucine side chains from one alpha helix interdigitate with those from the alpha helix of a second polypeptide, facilitating dimerization.&#xD;Leucine zippers are a dimerization domain of the bZIP (Basic-region leucine zipper) class of eukaryotic transcription factors. The bZIP domains is 60 to 80 amino acids in length with a highly conserved DNA binding basic region and a more diversified leucine zipper dimerization region. The leucine zipper is a common three-dimensional structural motif in proteins and it has that name because leucines occur every seven amino acids in the dimerization domain. The localization of the leucines are critical for the DNA binding to the proteins. Leucine zippers are present in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic regulatory proteins, but are mainly a feature of eukaryotes. They can also be annotated simply as ZIPs and ZIP-like motifs have been found in proteins other than transcription factors and are thought to be one of the general protein modules for protein-protein interactions.&#xD;The mechanism of transcriptional regulation by bZIP proteins has been studied in detail. Most bZIP proteins show high binding affinity for the ACGT motifs, which include CACGTG (G box), GACGTC (C box), TACGTA (A box), AACGTT (T box), and a GCN4 motif, namely TGA(G/C)TCA. A small number of bZIP factors such as OsOBF1 can also recognize palindromic sequences. However, the others, including LIP19, OsZIP-2a, and OsZIP-2b, do not bind to DNA sequences. Instead, these bZIP proteins form heterodimers with other bZIPs to regulate transcriptional activities.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wikipedia</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leucine_zipper&amp;oldid=679085270</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\UDS4P9TB\2015 - Leucine zipper.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-11-17 14:30:16</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Surujon, Defne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Creating an RdeA-/fbxA- Double Knockout to Investigate Intracellular Signalling Processes in Dictyostelium Discoideum</title></titles><pages>260</pages><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Amherst College</publisher><remote-database-name>Google Books</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><text-urls><url>https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=0SvtoQEACAAJ</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Won, Kyu Yeoun</author><author>Kim, Youn Wha</author><author>Kim, Hyun-Sook</author><author>Lee, Seung Kwan</author><author>Jung, Woon-Won</author><author>Park, Yong-Koo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MicroRNA-199b-5p is involved in the Notch signaling pathway in osteosarcoma</title><secondary-title>Human Pathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human Pathology</full-title><abbr-1>Hum.

The investigation of miRNA expression between healthy subjects and patients with osteosarcoma is crucial for future clinical trials. We performed miRNA microarray analysis on 8 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded osteosarcoma tissue samples. We confirmed the results of the microarray analysis using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. miRNA profiling of osteosarcoma tissue samples showed that expression of 10 miRNAs had increased 10-fold compared with normal controls. Among the 10 miRNAs, 3 miRNAs (miR-199b-5p, miR-338-3p, and miR-891a) were confirmed to have been up-regulated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. After transfection of 4 osteosarcoma cell lines with miR-199b-5p inhibitor, the expression of Notch pathway components in the transfected cell lines was changed. These results revealed that miR-199b-5p plays a role in Notch signaling in osteosarcoma. Recently, the inhibition of Notch and HES1 signaling has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent metastasis in human osteosarcoma. Taken together with our results, we suggest that miR-199b-5p inhibitor may also be a therapeutic option for osteosarcoma.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23574781</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kimchi-Sarfaty, Chava</author><author>Oh, Jung Mi</author><author>Kim, In-Wha</author><author>Sauna, Zuben E.</author><author>Calcagno, Anna Maria</author><author>Ambudkar, Suresh V.</author><author>Gottesman, Michael M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A "Silent" Polymorphism in the MDR1 Gene Changes Substrate Specificity</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title><abbr-1>Science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>525-528</pages><volume>315</volume><number>5811</number><issue>5811</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>01/26/2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0036-8075, 1095-9203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1135308</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not produce altered coding sequences, and therefore they are not expected to change the function of the protein in which they occur.

Dscam encodes 38,016 distinct isoforms via extensive alternative splicing. The 95 alternative exons in Dscam are organized into clusters that are spliced in a mutually exclusive manner. The exon 6 cluster contains 48 variable exons and uses a complex system of competing RNA structures to ensure that only one variable exon is included. Here we show that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hrp36 acts specifically within, and throughout, the exon 6 cluster to prevent the inclusion of multiple exons. Moreover, hrp36 prevents serine/arginine-rich proteins from promoting the ectopic inclusion of multiple exon 6 variants. Thus, the fidelity of mutually exclusive splicing in the exon 6 cluster is governed by an intricate combination of alternative RNA structures and a globally acting splicing repressor.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050534/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\CQ88JU96\Olson et al. - 2007 - A regulator of Dscam mutually exclusive splicing f.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050534/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-10-23 03:30:37</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheetham, G.

As T7RNAP is homologous to the Pol I family of DNA polymerases, the differences between the structure of T7RNAP complexed to substrates and that of the corresponding DNA polymerase complex provides a structural basis for understanding many of these functional differences. T7RNAP initiates RNA synthesis at promoter sequences that are conserved from positions -17 to +6 relative to the start site of transcription. The crystal structure at 2.4 A resolution of T7RNAP complexed with a 17-base-pair promoter shows that the four base pairs closest to the catalytic active site have melted to form a transcription bubble. The T7 promoter sequence is recognized by interactions in the major groove between an antiparallel beta-loop and bases. The amino-terminal domain is involved in promoter recognition and DNA melting. We have also used homology modelling of the priming and incoming nucleoside triphosphates from the T7 DNA-polymerase ternary complex structure to explain the specificity of T7RNAP for ribonucleotides, its ability to initiate from a single nucleotide, and the abortive cycling at the initiation of transcription.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10331394</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Russell, Jackie</author><author>Zomerdijk, Joost C.

The level of rRNA synthesis, mediated by Pol I (RNA polymerase I), therefore has a major impact on the life and destiny of a cell. In order to elucidate how cells achieve the stringent control of Pol I transcription, matching the supply of rRNA to demand under different cellular growth conditions, it is essential to understand the components and mechanics of the Pol I transcription machinery. In this review, we discuss: (i) the molecular composition and functions of the Pol I enzyme complex and the two main Pol I transcription factors, SL1 (selectivity factor 1) and UBF (upstream binding factor); (ii) the interplay between these factors during pre-initiation complex formation at the rDNA promoter in mammalian cells; and (iii) the cellular control of the Pol I transcription machinery.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16626300</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Y.</author><author>Geiger, J.

Profiling of miRNAs in the prefrontal cortex of a second independent cohort of 49 patients grouped by Braak stages revealed 41 deregulated miRNAs. We focused on miR-132-3p which is strongly altered in both brain areas. Downregulation of this miRNA occurs already at Braak stages III and IV, before loss of neuron-specific miRNAs. Next-generation sequencing confirmed a strong decrease of miR-132-3p and of three family-related miRNAs encoded by the same miRNA cluster on chromosome 17. Deregulation of miR-132-3p in AD brain appears to occur mainly in neurons displaying Tau hyper-phosphorylation. We provide evidence that miR-132-3p may contribute to disease progression through aberrant regulation of mRNA targets in the Tau network. The transcription factor (TF) FOXO1a appears to be a key target of miR-132-3p in this pathway.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24014289</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bartel, David P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MicroRNAs: Genomics, Biogenesis, Mechanism, and Function</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title><short-title>MicroRNAs</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title><abbr-1>Cell</abbr-1></periodical><pages>281-297</pages><volume>116</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>January 23, 2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0092-8674</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00045-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous ∼22 nt RNAs that can play important regulatory roles in animals and plants by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression.

The cause of AD remains unknown, and there are currently no effective treatments to stop or reverse the progression of this uniquely human and age-related neurological disorder. Elucidation of the AD mechanism and factors that contribute to the initiation, progression, and spreading of this chronic and fatal neurodegeneration will ultimately result in improved and effective diagnostics and therapeutic strategies. microRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a relatively recently discovered category of 20–24 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that function post-transcriptionally in shaping the transcriptome of the cell, and in doing so, contribute to the molecular-genetics and phenotype of human CNS health and disease. To date about 2550 unique mature human miRNAs have been characterized, however only highly selected miRNA populations appear to be enriched in different anatomical compartments within the CNS. This general commentary for the ‘Special Issue: 40th Year of Neurochemical Research’ will bring into perspective (i) some very recent findings on the extraordinary biophysics and signaling properties of CNS miRNA in AD and aging human brain; (ii) how specific intrinsic biophysical attributes of miRNAs may play defining roles in the establishment, proliferation and spreading of the AD phenotype; and (iii) how miRNAs can serve as prospective therapeutic targets and biomarkers potentially useful in the clinical management of this terminal neurological disease whose incidence in our rapidly aging population is reaching epidemic proportions.</abstract><remote-database-name>link.springer.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11064-015-1734-7</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\HCT8VUCG\Hill and Lukiw - 2015 - microRNA (miRNA)-Mediated Pathogenetic Signaling i.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\IJCEKGBV\Hill and Lukiw - 2015 - microRNA (miRNA)-Mediated Pathogenetic Signaling i.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-10-13 19:32:34</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kawaji, Hideya</author><author>Schönbach, Christian</author><author>Matsuo, Yo</author><author>Kawai, Jun</author><author>Okazaki, Yasushi</author><author>Hayashizaki, Yoshihide</author><author>Matsuda, Hideo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploration of novel motifs derived from mouse cDNA sequences</title><secondary-title>Genome Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Research</full-title><abbr-1>Genome Res.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>367-378</pages><volume>12</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Computational Biology</keyword><keyword>Models, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Molecular Sequence Data</keyword><keyword>Animals</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Mice</keyword><keyword>Protein Structure, Tertiary</keyword><keyword>Carrier Proteins</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid Sequence</keyword><keyword>Sequence Alignment</keyword><keyword>Sequence Homology, Amino Acid</keyword><keyword>Membrane Proteins</keyword><keyword>Multigene Family</keyword><keyword>1-Acylglycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase</keyword><keyword>Acyltransferases</keyword><keyword>Amino Acid Motifs</keyword><keyword>Base Composition</keyword><keyword>Databases, Protein</keyword><keyword>DNA, Complementary</keyword><keyword>False Positive Reactions</keyword><keyword>Leucine Zippers</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>Mar 2002</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1088-9051</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.193702. Article published online before print in February 2002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We performed a systematic maximum density subgraph (MDS) detection of conserved sequence regions to discover new, biologically relevant motifs from a set of 21,050 conceptually translated mouse cDNA (FANTOM1) sequences. A total of 3202 candidate sequences, which shared similar regions over &gt;20 amino acid residues, were screened against known conserved regions listed in Pfam, ProDom, and InterPro. The filtering procedure resulted in 139 FANTOM1 sequences belonging to 49 new motif candidates. Using annotations and multiple sequence alignment information, we removed by visual inspection 42 candidates whose members were found to be false positives because of sequence redundancy, alternative splicing, low complexity, transcribed retroviral repeat elements contained in the region of the predicted open reading frame, and reports in the literature. The remaining seven motifs have been expanded by hidden Markov model (HMM) profile searches of SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL from 28 FANTOM1 sequences to 164 members and analyzed in detail on sequence and structure level to elucidate the possible functions of motifs and members. The novel and conserved motif MDS00105 is specific for the mammalian inhibitor of growth (ING) family. Three submotifs MDS00105.1-3 are specific for ING1/ING1L, ING1-homolog, and ING3 subfamilies. The motif MDS00105 together with a PHD finger domain constitutes a module for ING proteins. Structural motif MDS00113 represents a leucine zipper-like motif. Conserved motif MDS00145 is a novel 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) submotif containing a transmembrane domain that distinguishes AGPAT3 and AGPAT4 from all other acyltransferase domain-containing proteins. Functional motif MDS00148 overlaps with the kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domain but has been detected only in an extracellular loop region of solute carrier 21 (SLC21) (organic anion transporters) family members, which may regulate the specificity of anion uptake. Our motif discovery not only aided in the functional characterization of new mouse orthologs for potential drug targets but also allowed us to predict that at least 16 other new motifs are waiting to be discovered from the current SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL database.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11875024</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Derrien, Muriel</author><author>Vaughan, Elaine E.</author><author>Plugge, Caroline M.</author><author>de Vos, Willem M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Akkermansia muciniphila gen. nov., sp. nov., a human intestinal mucin-degrading bacterium</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Int.

A dominant bacterium, strain MucT, was isolated by dilution to extinction of faeces in anaerobic medium containing gastric mucin as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. A pure culture was obtained using the anaerobic soft agar technique. Strain MucT was a Gram-negative, strictly anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, oval-shaped bacterium that could grow singly and in pairs. When grown on mucin medium, cells produced a capsule and were found to aggregate. Strain MucT could grow on a limited number of sugars, including N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine and glucose, but only when a protein source was provided and with a lower growth rate and final density than on mucin. The G + C content of DNA from strain MucT was 47.6 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolate was part of the division Verrucomicrobia. The closest described relative of strain MucT was Verrucomicrobium spinosum (92 % sequence similarity). Remarkably, the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain MucT showed 99 % similarity to three uncultured colonic bacteria. According to the data obtained in this work, strain MucT represents a novel bacterium belonging to a new genus in subdivision 1 of the Verrucomicrobia; the name Akkermansia muciniphila gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is MucT (= ATCC BAA-835T = CIP 107961T).</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15388697</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>The Cre-lox and FLP-FRT systems</title></titles><dates/><abstract>Both the Cre-lox and FLP-FRT technologies allow the location and timing of gene expression to be closely regulated in a mouse.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/2006/may/the-cre-lox-and-flp-frt-systems</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\UDAEASED\The Cre-lox and FLP-FRT systems.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-10-08 16:32:55</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sigrist, Christian J.

The significant absorption and emission changes accompanying the interaction of the fluorescent derivative 7-amino-AMD with DNAs varying in length and base composition were used to calculate affinity constants for the drug-DNA complexes. The guanine-containing trinucleotide sequences AGT, AGA, and TGT embedded within 25-base oligonucleotides, constituted favorable binding sites. In contrast, the sequence TGA did not bind the drug appreciably. Among the DNAs studied, the highest affinity was for the tetranucleotide sequence TAGT. The binding was length dependent, an oligonucleotide of at least 14 bases being required for effective complex formation (Ka &gt; 10(4) M1=). AMD also bound to poly(d(AGT)). Gel electrophoresis confirmed that the complex was formed between the drug and individual unstructured DNA strands. The 1H NMR spectra of oligonucleotides containing the TAGT site and their complexes with AMD provided further insight into the mode(s) of interaction. A comparison of the measured chemical shifts with those estimated from ring-current calculations provided strong evidence for a hemi-intercalation of AMD between the A and G purine bases with a preference for one of two possible relative orientations. The latter were modeled as complexes with the sequence T3AGT3 and refined by force field calculations with the AMBER program. The biological implications for this novel form of interaction of AMD with single-stranded DNA are discussed.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8809179</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patrick, Graham L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Introduction to Medicinal Chemistry</title></titles><pages>776</pages><keywords><keyword>Business &amp; Economics / Industries / Pharmaceutical &amp; Biotechnology</keyword><keyword>Medical / General</keyword><keyword>Science / Chemistry / General</keyword><keyword>Science / Chemistry / Organic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-01-22</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>OUP Oxford</publisher><isbn>978-0-19-923447-9</isbn><abstract>The average person in the UK will take more than 14,000 pills over the course of their life, yet few people consider the long road of development that has made that drug work without being toxic. An Introduction to Medicinal Chemistry presents the field in an engaging style that is very accessible to students. Medicinal chemistry is a fast-moving field whose continuous new developments have far-reaching implications for world health. As such, this text presents a complete course in medicinal chemistry, from first principles of drug action, to design and development, to specific drugs from HIV inhibitors to painkillers. The book builds on the history of drug development, but does not assume much background knowledge. The focus is on building upon the understandings of the molecular function of drugs, and from there, taking a broad overview of the topical issues and most frequently used techniques. An Introduction to Medicinal Chemistry remains a leading text for the growing number of medicinal chemistry courses internationally, especially as modules in medical chemistry become a more popular option on chemistry courses. With enhanced attention to the pedagogical details such as key points and boxes, as well as having specific case studies highlighted in distinct sections, Patrick's new edition enables a full understanding of the subject and a clear idea of where the field is heading.

For most of this time data was only available for a few alleles, and thus we had only a restricted view of the whole fitness landscape. Recently, advances in genetics and molecular biology allow a more detailed view of them. Here we review experimental and theoretical studies of fitness landscapes of functional RNAs, especially aptamers and ribozymes. We find that RNA structures can be divided into critical structures, connecting structures, neutral structures and forbidden structures. Such characterisation, coupled with theoretical sequence-to-structure predictions, allows us to construct the whole fitness landscape. Fitness landscapes then can be used to study evolution, and in our case the development of the RNA world.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26308059</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cléry, Antoine</author><author>Jayne, Sandrine</author><author>Benderska, Natalya</author><author>Dominguez, Cyril</author><author>Stamm, Stefan</author><author>Allain, Frédéric H.-T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular basis of purine-rich RNA recognition by the human SR-like protein Tra2-β1</title><secondary-title>Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Nat Struct Mol Biol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>443-450</pages><volume>18</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>April 2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1545-9993</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nsmb.2001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Tra2-β1 is a unique splicing factor as its single RNA recognition motif (RRM) is located between two RS (arginine-serine) domains. To understand how this protein recognizes its RNA target, we solved the structure of Tra2-β1 RRM in complex with RNA. The central 5′-AGAA-3′ motif is specifically recognized by residues from the β-sheet of the RRM and by residues from both extremities flanking the RRM. The structure suggests that RNA binding by Tra2-β1 induces positioning of the two RS domains relative to one another. By testing the effect of Tra2-β1 and RNA mutations on the splicing of SMN2 exon 7, we validated the importance of the RNA-protein contacts observed in the structure for the function of Tra2-β1 and determined the functional sequence of Tra2-β1 in SMN2 exon 7. Finally, we propose a model for the assembly of multiple RNA binding proteins on this exon.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v18/n4/full/nsmb.2001.html</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-09-08 03:58:48</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Humphrey, W.</author><author>Dalke, A.</author><author>Schulten, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>VMD: visual molecular dynamics</title><secondary-title>Journal of Molecular Graphics</secondary-title><short-title>VMD</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Molecular Graphics</full-title><abbr-1>J Mol Graph</abbr-1></periodical><pages>33-38, 27-28</pages><volume>14</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Computers</keyword><keyword>Models, Molecular</keyword><keyword>User-Computer Interface</keyword><keyword>Proteins</keyword><keyword>Computer Simulation</keyword><keyword>Computer Graphics</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acids</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>Feb 1996</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0263-7855</isbn><abstract>VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8744570</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Podust, Larissa M.</author><author>Ioanoviciu, Alexandra</author><author>Ortiz de Montellano, Paul R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>2.3 Å X-ray Structure of the Heme-Bound GAF Domain of Sensory Histidine Kinase DosT of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title><secondary-title>Biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemistry</full-title><abbr-1>Biochemistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>12523-12531</pages><volume>47</volume><number>47</number><issue>47</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-11-25</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0006-2960</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/bi8012356</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mycobacterium tuberculosis responds to the changes in environmental conditions through a two-component signaling system that detects reduced O2 tension and NO and CO exposures via the heme-binding GAF domains of two sensory histidine kinases, DosT and DevS, and the transcriptional regulator DosR. We report the first x-ray structure of the DosT heme-bound GAF domain (GAFDosT) in both oxy and deoxy forms determined to a resolution of 2.3 Å. In GAFDosT, heme binds in an orientation orthogonal to that in the PAS domains via a highly conserved motif including invariant H147 as a proximal heme axial ligand. On the distal side, invariant Y169 is in stacking interactions with the heme with its long axis parallel and the plane of the ring orthogonal to the heme plane. In one of the two protein monomers in an asymmetric unit, O2 binds as a second axial ligand to the heme iron, and is stabilized via an H-bond to the OH-group of Y169. The structure reveals two small tunnel-connected cavities and a pore on the protein surface that suggest a potential route for O2 access to the sensing pocket. The limited conformational differences observed between differently heme iron-ligated GAFDosT monomers in the asymmetric unit may result from crystal lattice limitations since atmospheric oxygen binding likely occurs in the crystal as a result of x-ray induced Fe3+ photoreduction during diffraction data collection. Determination of the GAFDosT structure sets up a framework in which to address ligand-recognition, discrimination, and signal propagation schemes in the heme-based GAF domains of biological sensors.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645934/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\VK9M9P29\Podust et al. - 2008 - 2.3 Å X-ray Structure of the Heme-Bound GAF Domain.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645934/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-08-29 16:47:09</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mitchell, Alex</author><author>Chang, Hsin-Yu</author><author>Daugherty, Louise</author><author>Fraser, Matthew</author><author>Hunter, Sarah</author><author>Lopez, Rodrigo</author><author>McAnulla, Craig</author><author>McMenamin, Conor</author><author>Nuka, Gift</author><author>Pesseat, Sebastien</author><author>Sangrador-Vegas, Amaia</author><author>Scheremetjew, Maxim</author><author>Rato, Claudia</author><author>Yong, Siew-Yit</author><author>Bateman, Alex</author><author>Punta, Marco</author><author>Attwood, Teresa K.</author><author>Sigrist, Christian J.

Central to the InterPro database are predictive models, known as signatures, from a range of different protein family databases that have different biological focuses and use different methodological approaches to classify protein families and domains. InterPro integrates these signatures, capitalizing on the respective strengths of the individual databases, to produce a powerful protein classification resource. Here, we report on the status of InterPro as it enters its 15th year of operation, and give an overview of new developments with the database and its associated Web interfaces and software. In particular, the new domain architecture search tool is described and the process of mapping of Gene Ontology terms to InterPro is outlined. We also discuss the challenges faced by the resource given the explosive growth in sequence data in recent years.

The majority of signaling proteins are multidomain in character with a considerable variety of domain combinations known. Comparison with established databases showed that 25% of our domain set could not be deduced from SwissProt and 41% could not be annotated by Pfam. SMART is able to determine the modular architectures of single sequences or genomes; application to the entire yeast genome revealed that at least 6.7% of its genes contain one or more signaling domains, approximately 350 greater than previously annotated. The process of constructing SMART predicted (i) novel domain homologues in unexpected locations such as band 4.1-homologous domains in focal adhesion kinases; (ii) previously unknown domain families, including a citron-homology domain; (iii) putative functions of domain families after identification of additional family members, for example, a ubiquitin-binding role for ubiquitin-associated domains (UBA); (iv) cellular roles for proteins, such predicted DEATH domains in netrin receptors further implicating these molecules in axonal guidance; (v) signaling domains in known disease genes such as SPRY domains in both marenostrin/pyrin and Midline 1; (vi) domains in unexpected phylogenetic contexts such as diacylglycerol kinase homologues in yeast and bacteria; and (vii) likely protein misclassifications exemplified by a predicted pleckstrin homology domain in a Candida albicans protein, previously described as an integrin.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/95/11/5857</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\9ZPGQIUC\Schultz et al. - 1998 - SMART, a simple modular architecture research tool.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9600884</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\2JMIRC8V\Schultz et al. - 1998 - SMART, a simple modular architecture research tool.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-07-28 16:49:20</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Consortium, The UniProt</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>UniProt: a hub for protein information</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acids Research</secondary-title><short-title>UniProt</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic Acids Research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucl.

Since the last update article 2 years ago, we have generated 1182 new families and maintained sequence coverage of the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) at nearly 80%, despite a 50% increase in the size of the underlying sequence database. Since our 2012 article describing Pfam, we have also undertaken a comprehensive review of the features that are provided by Pfam over and above the basic family data. For each feature, we determined the relevance, computational burden, usage statistics and the functionality of the feature in a website context. As a consequence of this review, we have removed some features, enhanced others and developed new ones to meet the changing demands of computational biology. Here, we describe the changes to Pfam content. Notably, we now provide family alignments based on four different representative proteome sequence data sets and a new interactive DNA search interface.

We evaluated the influence of TLR2 and TLR4 in the spontaneous contractions and serotonin (5-HT)-induced motor response in mouse ileum, and the 5-HT receptors involved.&#xD;&#xD;Methods&#xD;&#xD;Muscle contractility studies to evaluate the spontaneous intestinal motility and the response to 5-HT were performed in the ileum from wild type (WT), TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, and TLR2/4 double knockout (DKO) mice. 5-HT receptor expression was determined by real-time PCR.&#xD;&#xD;Key Results&#xD;&#xD;The amplitude of spontaneous contractions in ileum was higher in TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, and TLR2/4 DKO mice with respect to WT. 5-HT evoked concentration-dependent contractile responses in the ileum from TLR2−/− and TLR4−/− mice similar to WT. However, in ileum from TLR2/4 DKO, 5-HT did not induce any contractile response. Expression of 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptors resulted increased in ileum from TLR4−/− and TLR2/4 DKO. Expression of the 5-HT4 receptor was diminished in TLR2−/− and TLR2/4 DKO. High levels of 5-HT7 receptor expression were found in TLR2/4 DKO but not in TLR2−/− or TLR4−/−. In WT and TLR4−/−, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonists reduced the contractile response evoked by 5-HT. In TLR2−/− mice, 5-HT4 antagonist did not reduce the 5-HT response. In TLR2/4 DKO mice, only 5-HT4 and 5-HT7 receptor antagonists reduced the relaxing response induced by 5-HT.&#xD;&#xD;Conclusions &amp; Inferences&#xD;&#xD;TLR2 and TLR4 signaling may modulate the spontaneous contractions and the serotonin contractile response by acting on 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, and 5-HT7 receptors.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nmo.12619/abstract</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\AINM4VVZ\Forcén et al. - 2015 - Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 modulate the contracti.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\QK8Q7GEE\Forcén et al. - 2015 - Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 modulate the contracti.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-07-02 19:58:47</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Danshan</author><author>Dhawan, Tania</author><author>Young, Stephen</author><author>Yong, William H</author><author>Boros, Laszlo G</author><author>Heaney, Anthony P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fructose impairs glucose-induced hepatic triglyceride synthesis</title><secondary-title>Lipids in Health and Disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lipids in Health and Disease</full-title><abbr-1>Lipids Health Dis</abbr-1></periodical><pages>20</pages><volume>10</volume><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-1-24</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1476-511X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1476-511X-10-20</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Obesity, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia frequently coexist and are associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Consumption of refined carbohydrate and particularly fructose has increased significantly in recent years and has paralled the increased incidence of obesity and diabetes. Human and animal studies have demonstrated that high dietary fructose intake positively correlates with increased dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Metabolism of fructose occurs primarily in the liver and high fructose flux leads to enhanced hepatic triglyceride accumulation (hepatic steatosis). This results in impaired glucose and lipid metabolism and increased proinflammatory cytokine expression. Here we demonstrate that fructose alters glucose-stimulated expression of activated acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), pSer hormone sensitive lipase (pSerHSL) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in hepatic HepG2 or primary hepatic cell cultures in vitro. This was associated with increased de novo triglyceride synthesis in vitro and hepatic steatosis in vivo in fructose- versus glucose-fed and standard-diet fed mice. These studies provide novel insight into the mechanisms involved in fructose-mediated hepatic hypertriglyceridemia and identify fructose-uptake as a new potential therapeutic target for lipid-associated diseases.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032722/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\B4ESASFM\Huang et al. - 2011 - Fructose impairs glucose-induced hepatic triglycer.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032722/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2015-07-02 14:23:47</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cani, P.

Our recent data support the idea that a selective increase of Bifidobacterium spp. reduces the impact of high-fat diet-induced metabolic endotoxaemia and inflammatory disorders. Here, we hypothesised that prebiotic modulation of gut microbiota lowers intestinal permeability, by a mechanism involving glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) thereby improving inflammation and metabolic disorders during obesity and diabetes.&#xD;METHODS: Study 1: ob/ob mice (Ob-CT) were treated with either prebiotic (Ob-Pre) or non-prebiotic carbohydrates as control (Ob-Cell). Study 2: Ob-CT and Ob-Pre mice were treated with GLP-2 antagonist or saline. Study 3: Ob-CT mice were treated with a GLP-2 agonist or saline. We assessed changes in the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, gut peptides, intestinal epithelial tight-junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin (qPCR and immunohistochemistry), hepatic and systemic inflammation.&#xD;RESULTS: Prebiotic-treated mice exhibited a lower plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines, and a decreased hepatic expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. This decreased inflammatory tone was associated with a lower intestinal permeability and improved tight-junction integrity compared to controls. Prebiotic increased the endogenous intestinotrophic proglucagon-derived peptide (GLP-2) production whereas the GLP-2 antagonist abolished most of the prebiotic effects. Finally, pharmacological GLP-2 treatment decreased gut permeability, systemic and hepatic inflammatory phenotype associated with obesity to a similar extent as that observed following prebiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota.&#xD;CONCLUSION: We found that a selective gut microbiota change controls and increases endogenous GLP-2 production, and consequently improves gut barrier functions by a GLP-2-dependent mechanism, contributing to the improvement of gut barrier functions during obesity and diabetes.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19240062</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hunter, Sarah</author><author>Jones, Philip</author><author>Mitchell, Alex</author><author>Apweiler, Rolf</author><author>Attwood, Teresa K.</author><author>Bateman, Alex</author><author>Bernard, Thomas</author><author>Binns, David</author><author>Bork, Peer</author><author>Burge, Sarah</author><author>Castro, Edouard de</author><author>Coggill, Penny</author><author>Corbett, Matthew</author><author>Das, Ujjwal</author><author>Daugherty, Louise</author><author>Duquenne, Lauranne</author><author>Finn, Robert D.</author><author>Fraser, Matthew</author><author>Gough, Julian</author><author>Haft, Daniel</author><author>Hulo, Nicolas</author><author>Kahn, Daniel</author><author>Kelly, Elizabeth</author><author>Letunic, Ivica</author><author>Lonsdale, David</author><author>Lopez, Rodrigo</author><author>Madera, Martin</author><author>Maslen, John</author><author>McAnulla, Craig</author><author>McDowall, Jennifer</author><author>McMenamin, Conor</author><author>Mi, Huaiyu</author><author>Mutowo-Muellenet, Prudence</author><author>Mulder, Nicola</author><author>Natale, Darren</author><author>Orengo, Christine</author><author>Pesseat, Sebastien</author><author>Punta, Marco</author><author>Quinn, Antony F.</author><author>Rivoire, Catherine</author><author>Sangrador-Vegas, Amaia</author><author>Selengut, Jeremy D.</author><author>Sigrist, Christian J.

In this study, 531 Escherichia coli isolates obtained from the Yamato River in Japan were evaluated phenotypically for resistance to 25 antimicrobials. Seventy-six isolates (14.3%) were multidrug resistant (MDR), 66 (12.4%) were nonsusceptible to one or two classes of agents, and 389 (73.3%) were susceptible. We performed whole-genome sequencing of selected strains by using Illumina technology. In total, the genome sequences of 155 strains were analyzed for antibiotic resistance determinants and phylogenetic characteristics. More than 50 different resistance determinants, including acquired resistance genes and chromosomal resistance mutations, were detected. Among the sequenced MDR strains (n = 66), sequence type 155 (ST155) complex (n = 9), ST10 complex (n = 9), and ST69 complex (n = 7) were prevalent. Among extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains (n = 58), clinically important clonal groups, namely, ST95 complex (n = 18), ST127 complex (n = 8), ST12 complex (n = 6), ST14 complex (n = 6), and ST131 complex (n = 6), were prevalent, demonstrating the clonal distribution of environmental ExPEC strains. Typing of the fimH (type 1 fimbrial adhesin) gene revealed that ST131 complex strains carried fimH22 or fimH41, and no strains belonging to the fimH30 subgroup were detected. Fine-scale phylogenetic analysis and virulence gene content analysis of strains belonging to the ST95 complex (one of the major clonal ExPEC groups causing community-onset infections) revealed no significant differences between environmental and clinical strains. The results indicate contamination of surface waters by E. coli strains belonging to clinically important clonal groups.&#xD;IMPORTANCE The prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant and pathogenic E. coli strains in surface waters is a concern because surface waters are used as sources for drinking water, irrigation, and recreational purposes. In this study, MDR and ExPEC strains in river water were characterized by genomic sequencing and analysis. We detected more than 50 resistance determinants and identified clonal groups specific to MDR and ExPEC strains. This study showed contamination of surface waters by E. coli strains belonging to clinically important clonal groups. Overall, this study advances our understanding of environmental MDR and ExPEC strains.</abstract><remote-database-name>aem.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://aem.asm.org/content/83/5/e02703-16</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\P5RX2U8I\Gomi et al. - 2017 - Whole-Genome Analysis of Antimicrobial-Resistant a.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27986723</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PZQ69T5G\e02703-16.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-04 15:35:12</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grandjean, Louis</author><author>Gilman, Robert H.</author><author>Iwamoto, Tomatada</author><author>Köser, Claudio U.</author><author>Coronel, Jorge</author><author>Zimic, Mirko</author><author>Török, M.

Understanding how drug-resistant tuberculosis evolves can inform the development of new therapeutic and preventive strategies.&#xD;METHODS: Here, we use novel genome-wide analysis techniques to identify polymorphisms that are associated with drug resistance, adaptive evolution and the structure of the phylogenetic tree. A total of 471 samples from different patients collected between 2009 and 2013 in the Lima suburbs of Callao and Lima South were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform with 150bp paired-end reads. After alignment to the reference H37Rv genome, variants were called using standardized methodology. Genome-wide analysis was undertaken using custom written scripts implemented in R software.&#xD;RESULTS: High quality homoplastic single nucleotide polymorphisms were observed in genes known to confer drug resistance as well as genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis ESX secreted protein pathway, pks12, and close to toxin/anti-toxin pairs. Correlation of homoplastic variant sites identified that many were significantly correlated, suggestive of epistasis. Variation in genes coding for ESX secreted proteins also significantly disrupted phylogenetic structure. Mutations in ESX genes in key antigenic epitope positions were also found to disrupt tree topology.&#xD;CONCLUSION: Variation in these genes have a biologically plausible effect on immunogenicity and virulence. This makes functional characterization warranted to determine the effects of these polymorphisms on bacterial fitness and transmission.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29281674</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moura de Sousa, Jorge</author><author>Balbontín, Roberto</author><author>Durão, Paulo</author><author>Gordo, Isabel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multidrug-resistant bacteria compensate for the epistasis between resistances</title><secondary-title>PLoS biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS biology</full-title><abbr-1>PLoS Biol.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e2001741</pages><volume>15</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Base Sequence</keyword><keyword>Transcription Factors</keyword><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Alleles</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli Proteins</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Anti-Bacterial Agents</keyword><keyword>Drug Resistance, Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Directed Molecular Evolution</keyword><keyword>Epistasis, Genetic</keyword><keyword>Genetic Fitness</keyword><keyword>Microbial Sensitivity Tests</keyword><keyword>Peptide Elongation Factors</keyword><keyword>Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid</keyword><keyword>Ribosomal Proteins</keyword><keyword>Rifampin</keyword><keyword>Streptomycin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>Apr 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1545-7885</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pbio.2001741</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mutations conferring resistance to antibiotics are typically costly in the absence of the drug, but bacteria can reduce this cost by acquiring compensatory mutations. Thus, the rate of acquisition of compensatory mutations and their effects are key for the maintenance and dissemination of antibiotic resistances. While compensation for single resistances has been extensively studied, compensatory evolution of multiresistant bacteria remains unexplored. Importantly, since resistance mutations often interact epistatically, compensation of multiresistant bacteria may significantly differ from that of single-resistant strains. We used experimental evolution, next-generation sequencing, in silico simulations, and genome editing to compare the compensatory process of a streptomycin and rifampicin double-resistant Escherichia coli with those of single-resistant clones. We demonstrate that low-fitness double-resistant bacteria compensate faster than single-resistant strains due to the acquisition of compensatory mutations with larger effects. Strikingly, we identified mutations that only compensate for double resistance, being neutral or deleterious in sensitive or single-resistant backgrounds. Moreover, we show that their beneficial effects strongly decrease or disappear in conditions where the epistatic interaction between resistance alleles is absent, demonstrating that these mutations compensate for the epistasis. In summary, our data indicate that epistatic interactions between antibiotic resistances, leading to large fitness costs, possibly open alternative paths for rapid compensatory evolution, thereby potentially stabilizing costly multiple resistances in bacterial populations.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28419091</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Trindade, Sandra</author><author>Sousa, Ana</author><author>Xavier, Karina Bivar</author><author>Dionisio, Francisco</author><author>Ferreira, Miguel Godinho</author><author>Gordo, Isabel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Positive epistasis drives the acquisition of multidrug resistance</title><secondary-title>PLoS genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS genetics</full-title><abbr-1>PLoS Genet.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e1000578</pages><volume>5</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Mutation</keyword><keyword>Escherichia coli</keyword><keyword>Evolution, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Epistasis, Genetic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>Jul 2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1553-7404</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pgen.1000578</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The evolution of multiple antibiotic resistance is an increasing global problem. Resistance mutations are known to impair fitness, and the evolution of resistance to multiple drugs depends both on their costs individually and on how they interact--epistasis. Information on the level of epistasis between antibiotic resistance mutations is of key importance to understanding epistasis amongst deleterious alleles, a key theoretical question, and to improving public health measures. Here we show that in an antibiotic-free environment the cost of multiple resistance is smaller than expected, a signature of pervasive positive epistasis among alleles that confer resistance to antibiotics. Competition assays reveal that the cost of resistance to a given antibiotic is dependent on the presence of resistance alleles for other antibiotics. Surprisingly we find that a significant fraction of resistant mutations can be beneficial in certain resistant genetic backgrounds, that some double resistances entail no measurable cost, and that some allelic combinations are hotspots for rapid compensation. These results provide additional insight as to why multi-resistant bacteria are so prevalent and reveal an extra layer of complexity on epistatic patterns previously unrecognized, since it is hidden in genome-wide studies of genetic interactions using gene knockouts.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19629166</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>Fluoroquinolone resistance: mechanisms, impact on bacteria, and role in evolutionary success: Trends in Microbiology</title></titles><dates/><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cell.com/trends/microbiology/fulltext/S0966-842X(14)00089-4?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0966842X14000894%3Fshowall%3Dtrue</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ZSNACAH9\S0966-842X(14)00089-4.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-04 17:34:59</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Redgrave, Liam S.</author><author>Sutton, Sam B.</author><author>Webber, Mark A.</author><author>Piddock, Laura J.

Genetic differences between populations may make an important contribution to variation in rates of evolution, owing to differences in fitness, population size, mutation rates, or in the distribution of fitness effects (DFEs) of available beneficial mutations. By whole genome sequencing of Escherichia coli populations experimentally evolved in the presence of a quinolone antibiotic, we found that rates of substitution varied by genotype, with evidence for a contribution from a genotype's starting fitness. Subsequent targeted sequencing showed that genotypes with high average substitution rates were more likely to undergo the simultaneous fixation of several mutations, consistent with theoretical models of multiple mutation dynamics. Moreover, patterns of substitution were indicative of epistatic relationships between known resistance mutations.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12700/abstract</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6N9M32RL\abstract.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-04 17:36:16</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>Outpatient Antibiotic Prescriptions — United States, 2015 | Community | Antibiotic Use | CDC</title></titles><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-10-27T02:14:38Z</date></pub-dates></dates><language>en-us</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/programs-measurement/state-local-activities/outpatient-antibiotic-prescriptions-US-2015.html</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TQX63UVZ\outpatient-antibiotic-prescriptions-US-2015.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-04 17:37:21</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weibel, Douglas B.</author><author>DiLuzio, Willow R.</author><author>Whitesides, George M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Microfabrication meets microbiology</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>209-218</pages><volume>5</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1740-1534</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrmicro1616</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This Review summarizes methods for constructing systems and structures at micron or submicron scales that have applications in microbiology.

Whole genome amplification (WGA) is the first step for single-cell sequencing, but its throughput and accuracy are insufficient in conventional reaction platforms. Here, we introduce single droplet multiple displacement amplification (sd-MDA), a method that enables massively parallel amplification of single cell genomes while maintaining sequence accuracy and specificity. Tens of thousands of single cells are compartmentalized in millions of picoliter droplets and then subjected to lysis and WGA by passive droplet fusion in microfluidic channels. Because single cells are isolated in compartments, their genomes are amplified to saturation without contamination. This enables the high-throughput acquisition of contamination-free and cell specific sequence reads from single cells (21,000 single-cells/h), resulting in enhancement of the sequence data quality compared to conventional methods. This method allowed WGA of both single bacterial cells and human cancer cells. The obtained sequencing coverage rivals those of conventional techniques with superior sequence quality. In addition, we also demonstrate de novo assembly of uncultured soil bacteria and obtain draft genomes from single cell sequencing. This sd-MDA is promising for flexible and scalable use in single-cell sequencing.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05436-4</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\GC54BH6A\Hosokawa et al. - 2017 - Massively parallel whole genome amplification for .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\RFCXBAF8\s41598-017-05436-4.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-04 17:43:07</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Deatherage, Daniel E.</author><author>Barrick, Jeffrey E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of Mutations in Laboratory-Evolved Microbes from Next-Generation Sequencing Data Using breseq</title><secondary-title>Engineering and Analyzing Multicellular Systems</secondary-title><tertiary-title>Methods in Molecular Biology</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Engineering and Analyzing Multicellular Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>165-188</pages><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Humana Press, New York, NY</publisher><isbn>978-1-4939-0553-9 978-1-4939-0554-6</isbn><abstract>Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) can be used to reconstruct eco-evolutionary population dynamics and to identify the genetic basis of adaptation in laboratory evolution experiments.

A model for regulation based on formation of alternative RNA structures involving the RFN elements is suggested. In Gram-positive bacteria including actinomycetes, Thermotoga, Thermus and Deinococcus, the riboflavin metabolism and transport genes are predicted to be regulated by transcriptional attenuation, whereas in most Gram-negative bacteria, the riboflavin biosynthesis genes seem to be regulated on the level of translation initiation. Several new candidate riboflavin transporters were identified (impX in Desulfitobacterium halfniense and Fusobacterium nucleatum; pnuX in several actinomycetes, including some Corynebacterium species and Strepto myces coelicolor; rfnT in Rhizobiaceae). Traces of a number of likely horizontal transfer events were found: the complete riboflavin operon with the upstream regulatory element was transferred to Haemophilus influenzae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae from some Gram-positive bacterium; non-regulated riboflavin operon in Pyrococcus furiousus was likely transferred from Thermotoga; and the RFN element was inserted into the riboflavin operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from some other Pseudomonas species, where it had regulated the ribH2 gene.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC135753/</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC135753/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-07 01:41:20</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, Yu</author><author>Chen, Biao</author><author>Duan, Chunlan</author><author>Sun, Bingbing</author><author>Yang, Junjie</author><author>Yang, Sheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multigene Editing in the Escherichia coli Genome via the CRISPR-Cas9 System</title><secondary-title>Applied and Environmental Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied and Environmental Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Appl.

All individuals who had a positive urine culture result were included in this study. &#xD;&#xD;Results: &#xD;A total of 1,641 individuals met the inclusion criteria. Despite the fact that participants were female, we observed a higher rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin in males. The most frequent pathogens identified in urine samples were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Antimicrobial resistance has been observed mainly for ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin. Moreover, E. coli has shown the highest rate of ciprofloxacin resistance, reaching 36% of ciprofloxacin resistant strains in 2014. &#xD;&#xD;Conclusion:&#xD; The rate of bacterial resistance to ciprofloxacin observed in the studied population is much higher than expected, prompting the need for rational use of this antibiotic, especially in infections caused by E. coli. Prevention of bacterial resistance can be performed through control measures to limit the spread of resistant microorganisms and a rational use of antimicrobial policy.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4964322/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\UWYAPTUM\REIS et al. - 2016 - CIPROFLOXACIN RESISTANCE PATTERN AMONG BACTERIA IS.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4964322/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-07 20:09:58</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, Crystal L.</author><author>Singh, Shweta S.</author><author>Alamneh, Yonas</author><author>Casella, Leila G.</author><author>Ernst, Robert K.</author><author>Lesho, Emil P.</author><author>Waterman, Paige E.</author><author>Zurawski, Daniel V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In Vivo Fitness Adaptations of Colistin-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Isolates to Oxidative Stress</title><secondary-title>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</full-title><abbr-1>Antimicrob.

The opportunistic bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is extremely skilled at both colonizing and persisting in the airways of patients with lung damage. It has been suggested that the upper airways (including the paranasal sinuses and nasopharynx) play an important role as a silent reservoir of bacteria. Over time, P. aeruginosa can adapt to its niche, leading to increased resistance in the face of the immune system and intense therapy regimes. Here we describe a mouse inhalation model of P. aeruginosa chronic infection that can be studied for at least 28 days. We present evidence for adaptation in vivo, in terms of genotype and phenotype including antibiotic resistance. Our data suggest that there is persistence in the upper respiratory tract and that this is key in the establishment of lung infection.

Using the bacterium Salmonella enterica, we isolated mutants with resistance toward the peptide deformylase inhibitor actinonin. Resistance mutations were identified in two genes that are required for the formylation of methionyl (Met) initiator tRNA (tRNAi) fMet: the fmt gene encoding the enzyme methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase and the folD gene encoding the bifunctional enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate-dehydrogenase and -cyclohydrolase. In the absence of antibiotic, these resistance mutations conferred a fitness cost that was manifested as a reduced growth rate in laboratory medium and in mice. By serially passaging the low-fitness mutants in growth medium without antibiotic, the fitness costs could be partly ameliorated either by intragenic mutations in the fmt/folD genes or by extragenic compensatory mutations. Of the extragenically compensated fmt mutants, approximately one-third carried amplifications of the identical, tandemly repeated metZ and metW genes, encoding tRNAi. The increase in metZW gene copy number varied from 5- to 40-fold and was accompanied by a similar increase in tRNAi levels. The rise in tRNAi level compensated for the lack of methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase activity and allowed translation initiation to proceed with nonformylated methionyl tRNAi. Amplified units varied in size from 1.9 to 94 kbp. Suppression of deleterious mutations by gene amplification may be involved in the evolution of new gene functions.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/103/18/6976</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\L43GJ2GD\Nilsson et al. - 2006 - Reducing the fitness cost of antibiotic resistance.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16636273</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\U2L5Z4M6\6976.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-08 02:30:19</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walkiewicz, Katarzyna</author><author>Cardenas, Andres S.

We have tested this principle by generating a family of variants of the tetracycline resistance protein TetX2 and identified the physicochemical properties most correlated with organismal fitness. Surprisingly, small changes in the Km(MCN), less than twofold, were sufficient to produce highly successful adaptive mutants over clinically relevant drug concentrations. We then built a quantitative model directly relating the in vitro physicochemical properties of the mutant enzymes to the growth rates of bacteria carrying a single chromosomal copy of the tet(X2) variants over a wide range of minocycline (MCN) concentrations. Importantly, this model allows the prediction of enzymatic properties directly from cellular growth rates as well as the physicochemical-fitness landscape of TetX2. Using experimental evolution and deep sequencing to monitor the allelic frequencies of the seven most biochemically efficient TetX2 mutants in 10 independently evolving populations, we showed that the model correctly predicted the success of the two most beneficial variants tet(X2)T280A and tet(X2)N371I. The structure of the most efficient variant, TetX2T280A, in complex with MCN at 2.7 Å resolution suggests an indirect effect on enzyme kinetics. Taken together, these findings support an important role for readily accessible small steps in protein evolution that can, in turn, greatly increase the fitness of an organism during natural selection.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/109/52/21408</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\M7FXUYTG\Walkiewicz et al. - 2012 - Small changes in enzyme function can lead to surpr.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23236139</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\C3MHD58J\21408.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-08 02:30:22</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lan, Freeman</author><author>Haliburton, John R.</author><author>Yuan, Aaron</author><author>Abate, Adam R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Droplet barcoding for massively parallel single-molecule deep sequencing</title><secondary-title>Nature Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>11784</pages><volume>7</volume><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-06-29</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2041-1723</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncomms11784</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The ability to accurately sequence long DNA molecules is important across biology, but existing sequencers are limited in read length and accuracy.

In prokaryotes, however, A-to-I RNA editing was only reported to occur in tRNAs but not in protein-coding genes. By comparing DNA and RNA sequences of Escherichia coli, we show for the first time that A-to-I editing occurs also in prokaryotic mRNAs and has the potential to affect the translated proteins and cell physiology. We found 15 novel A-to-I editing events, of which 12 occurred within known protein-coding genes where they always recode a tyrosine (TAC) into a cysteine (TGC) codon. Furthermore, we identified the tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase (tadA) as the editing enzyme of all these editing sites, thus making it the first identified RNA editing enzyme that modifies both tRNAs and mRNAs. Interestingly, several of the editing targets are self-killing toxins that belong to evolutionarily conserved toxin-antitoxin pairs. We focused on hokB, a toxin that confers antibiotic tolerance by growth inhibition, as it demonstrated the highest level of such mRNA editing. We identified a correlated mutation pattern between the edited and a DNA hard-coded Cys residue positions in the toxin and demonstrated that RNA editing occurs in hokB in two additional bacterial species. Thus, not only the toxin is evolutionarily conserved but also the editing itself within the toxin is. Finally, we found that RNA editing in hokB increases as a function of cell density and enhances its toxicity. Our work thus demonstrates the occurrence, regulation, and functional consequences of RNA editing in bacteria.</abstract><remote-database-name>genome.cshlp.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2017/08/30/gr.222760.117</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8G9I4VXD\Bar-Yaacov et al. - 2017 - RNA editing in bacteria recodes multiple proteins .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28864459</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\BVA6ZYPV\gr.222760.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-14 23:09:43</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burger, Gertraud</author><author>Moreira, Sandrine</author><author>Valach, Matus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genes in Hiding</title><secondary-title>Trends in Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in Genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Trends in Genetics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>553-565</pages><volume>32</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>cryptic genes</keyword><keyword>diplonemids</keyword><keyword>gene fragmentation</keyword><keyword>multipartite mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)</keyword><keyword>RNA editing</keyword><keyword>trans-splicing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>September 1, 2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0168-9525</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tig.2016.06.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Unrecognizable genes are an unsettling problem in genomics. Here, we survey the various types of cryptic genes and the corresponding deciphering strategies employed by cells. Encryption that renders genes substantially different from homologs in other species includes sequence substitution, insertion, deletion, fragmentation plus scrambling, and invasion by mobile genetic elements. Cells decode cryptic genes at the DNA, RNA or protein level. We will focus on a recently discovered case of unparalleled encryption involving massive gene fragmentation and nucleotide deletions and substitutions, occurring in the mitochondrial genome of a poorly understood protist group, the diplonemids. This example illustrates that comprehensive gene detection requires not only auxiliary sequence information – transcriptome and proteome data – but also knowledge about a cell's deciphering arsenal.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016895251630066X</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\7JPB8H4B\Burger et al. - 2016 - Genes in Hiding.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3PKUB9AL\S016895251630066X.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-14 23:11:34</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morris, J.

This partitioning of benefits, also called ‘leakiness’, can produce negative frequency dependence of fitness in microbial communities, allowing coexistence between function-performing helpers and function-requiring beneficiaries. The ubiquity of leakiness favors a ‘race to the bottom’ as members of a community lose the ability to perform functions whose products are available from the environment. Rather than being social altruists, helpers are merely those populations that lost this race and got stuck in their role as function performers. Here I discuss many such BQ functions and the microbial communities that evolve around them. I also compile evidence from laboratory evolution experiments as well as phylogenetic reconstructions that show that organisms gain greater fitness increases from gene/function loss events than is commonly expected. Finally, I consider possible consequences of long-term BQ-stabilized coexistence, including sympatric speciation and the evolution of true mutualisms.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952515000931</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\9T8CC2ST\Morris - 2015 - Black Queen evolution the role of leakiness in st.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\IM6FTCBQ\S0168952515000931.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-15 00:47:10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>Evolvability of a viral protease: experimental evolution of catalysis, robustness and specificity</title></titles><dates/><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/245207</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\QGQBKHBR\245207.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-02-16 02:15:44</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Papp, Balázs</author><author>Notebaart, Richard A.</author><author>Pál, Csaba</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Systems-biology approaches for predicting genomic evolution</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>591-602</pages><volume>12</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrg3033</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Is evolution predictable at the molecular level?

By combining experimental evolution and genome sequencing of 63 laboratory-evolved lines, we charted a map of cross-resistance interactions between antibiotics in Escherichia coli, and explored the driving evolutionary principles. Here, we show that (1) convergent molecular evolution is prevalent across antibiotic treatments, (2) resistance conferring mutations simultaneously enhance sensitivity to many other drugs and (3) 27% of the accumulated mutations generate proteins with compromised activities, suggesting that antibiotic adaptation can partly be achieved without gain of novel function. By using knowledge on antibiotic properties, we examined the determinants of cross-resistance and identified chemogenomic profile similarity between antibiotics as the strongest predictor. In contrast, cross-resistance between two antibiotics is independent of whether they show synergistic effects in combination.

Most EE-WGS studies published to date have used microbes, owing to their ease of propagation and manipulation in the laboratory and relatively small genome sizes. These experiments are particularly suited to answer long-standing questions such as: How many mutations underlie adaptive evolution, and how are they distributed across the genome and through time? Are there general rules or principles governing which genes contribute to adaptation, and are certain kinds of genes more likely to be targets than others? How common is epistasis among adaptive mutations, and what does this reveal about the variety of genetic routes to adaptation? How common is parallel evolution, where the same mutations evolve repeatedly and independently in response to similar selective pressures? Here, we summarize the significant findings of this body of work, identify important emerging trends and propose promising directions for future research. We also outline an example of a computational pipeline for use in EE-WGS studies, based on freely available bioinformatics tools.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05484.x/abstract</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PIH5TES8\Dettman et al. - 2012 - Evolutionary insight from whole-genome sequencing .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\KTAC5RYW\abstract.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-11 18:06:11</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Opijnen, Tim van</author><author>Dedrick, Sandra</author><author>Bento, José</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Strain Dependent Genetic Networks for Antibiotic-Sensitivity in a Bacterial Pathogen with a Large Pan-Genome</title><secondary-title>PLOS Pathogens</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS Pathogens</full-title><abbr-1>PLOS Pathogens</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e1005869</pages><volume>12</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Genetic networks</keyword><keyword>Pneumococcus</keyword><keyword>Gene regulation</keyword><keyword>Regulator genes</keyword><keyword>Antibiotic resistance</keyword><keyword>Antibiotics</keyword><keyword>Bacterial pathogens</keyword><keyword>Genetic interactions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>Sep 8, 2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1553-7374</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.ppat.1005869</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The interaction between an antibiotic and bacterium is not merely restricted to the drug and its direct target, rather antibiotic induced stress seems to resonate through the bacterium, creating selective pressures that drive the emergence of adaptive mutations not only in the direct target, but in genes involved in many different fundamental processes as well. Surprisingly, it has been shown that adaptive mutations do not necessarily have the same effect in all species, indicating that the genetic background influences how phenotypes are manifested. However, to what extent the genetic background affects the manner in which a bacterium experiences antibiotic stress, and how this stress is processed is unclear. Here we employ the genome-wide tool Tn-Seq to construct daptomycin-sensitivity profiles for two strains of the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Remarkably, over half of the genes that are important for dealing with antibiotic-induced stress in one strain are dispensable in another. By confirming over 100 genotype-phenotype relationships, probing potassium-loss, employing genetic interaction mapping as well as temporal gene-expression experiments we reveal genome-wide conditionally important/essential genes, we discover roles for genes with unknown function, and uncover parts of the antibiotic’s mode-of-action. Moreover, by mapping the underlying genomic network for two query genes we encounter little conservation in network connectivity between strains as well as profound differences in regulatory relationships. Our approach uniquely enables genome-wide fitness comparisons across strains, facilitating the discovery that antibiotic responses are complex events that can vary widely between strains, which suggests that in some cases the emergence of resistance could be strain specific and at least for species with a large pan-genome less predictable.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005869</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\7LGJMD3W\Opijnen et al. - 2016 - Strain Dependent Genetic Networks for Antibiotic-S.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ZEYBBIAW\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-11 18:08:51</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Opijnen, Tim van</author><author>Camilli, Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A fine scale phenotype–genotype virulence map of a bacterial pathogen</title><secondary-title>Genome Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Research</full-title><abbr-1>Genome Res.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2541-2551</pages><volume>22</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>12/01/2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1088-9051, 1549-5469</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.137430.112</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A large fraction of the genes from sequenced organisms are of unknown function. This limits biological insight, and for pathogenic microorganisms hampers the development of new approaches to battle infections. There is thus a great need for novel strategies that link genotypes to phenotypes for microorganisms. We describe a high-throughput strategy based on the method Tn-seq that can be applied to any genetically manipulatable microorganism. By screening 17 in vitro and two in vivo (carriage and infection) conditions for the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, we create a resource consisting of &gt;1800 interactions that is rich in new genotype–phenotype relationships. We describe genes that are involved in differential carbon source utilization in the host, as well as genes that are involved both in virulence and in resistance against specific in vitro stresses, thereby revealing selection pressures that the pathogen experiences in vivo. We reveal the secondary response to an antibiotic, including a dual role efflux pump also involved in resistance to pH stress. Through genetic-interaction mapping and gene-expression analysis we define the mechanism of attenuation and the regulatory relationship between a two-component system and a core biosynthetic pathway specific to microorganisms. Thus, we have generated a resource that provides detailed insight into the biology and virulence of S. pneumoniae and provided a road map for similar discovery in other microorganisms.</abstract><remote-database-name>genome.cshlp.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://genome.cshlp.org/content/22/12/2541</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SLPPHXEM\Opijnen and Camilli - 2012 - A fine scale phenotype–genotype virulence map of a.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22826510</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\FUBGQBDG\2541.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-11 18:09:08</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>AlHoufie, Sari Talal S.</author><author>Foster, Howard A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of sub-lethal concentrations of mupirocin on global transcription in Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4 and a model for the escape from inhibition</title><secondary-title>Journal of Medical Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Medical Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Gene expression changes due to the stringent response have been studied in S. aureus using lethal concentrations of mupirocin, but no studies have investigated the effects of sub-lethal concentrations. S. aureus 8325-4 was exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of mupirocin. The production of ppGpp was assessed via HPLC and the effects on global transcription were studied by RNAseq (RNA sequencing) analysis. Growth inhibition had occurred after 1 h of treatment and metabolic analysis revealed that the stringent response alarmone ppGpp was present and GTP concentrations decreased. Transcriptome profiles showed that global transcriptional alterations were similar to those for S. aureus after treatment with lethal concentrations of mupirocin, including the repression of genes involved in transcription, translation and replication machineries. Furthermore, up-regulation of genes involved in stress responses, and amino acid biosynthesis and transport, as well as some virulence factor genes, was observed. However, ppGpp was not detectable after 12 or 24 h and cell growth had resumed, although some transcriptional changes remained. Sub-lethal concentrations of mupirocin induce the stringent response, but cells adapt and resume growth once ppGpp levels decrease.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27184545</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bresler, Guy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficiently learning Ising models on arbitrary graphs</title><secondary-title>arXiv:1411.6156 [cs, math, stat]</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv:1411.6156 [cs, math, stat]</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Computer Science - Information Theory</keyword><keyword>Computer Science - Learning</keyword><keyword>Statistics - Machine Learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-11-22</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>We consider the problem of reconstructing the graph underlying an Ising model from i.i.d. samples. Over the last fifteen years this problem has been of significant interest in the statistics, machine learning, and statistical physics communities, and much of the effort has been directed towards finding algorithms with low computational cost for various restricted classes of models. Nevertheless, for learning Ising models on general graphs with $p$ nodes of degree at most $d$, it is not known whether or not it is possible to improve upon the $p^{d}$ computation needed to exhaustively search over all possible neighborhoods for each node. In this paper we show that a simple greedy procedure allows to learn the structure of an Ising model on an arbitrary bounded-degree graph in time on the order of $p^2$. We make no assumptions on the parameters except what is necessary for identifiability of the model, and in particular the results hold at low-temperatures as well as for highly non-uniform models. The proof rests on a new structural property of Ising models: we show that for any node there exists at least one neighbor with which it has a high mutual information. This structural property may be of independent interest.</abstract><research-notes>Comment: 20 pages</research-notes><remote-database-name>arXiv.org</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6156</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\XPD8GTIR\Bresler - 2014 - Efficiently learning Ising models on arbitrary gra.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\EMUPI7VJ\1411.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-12 07:32:06</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buenrostro, Jason</author><author>Wu, Beijing</author><author>Chang, Howard</author><author>Greenleaf, William</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ATAC-seq: A Method for Assaying Chromatin Accessibility Genome-Wide</title><secondary-title>Current protocols in molecular biology / edited by Frederick M.

In this study, we analyzed transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles of 151 Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates under standard laboratory conditions and of one P. aeruginosa type strain under 14 different environmental conditions. Our approach allowed dissection of the impact of the genetic background versus environmental cues on P. aeruginosa gene expression profiles and revealed that phenotypic variation was larger in response to changing environments than between genomically different isolates. We demonstrate that mutations within the global regulator LasR affect more than one trait (pleiotropy) and that the interaction between mutations (epistasis) shapes the P. aeruginosa phenotypic plasticity landscape. Because of pleiotropic and epistatic effects, average genotype and phenotype measures appeared to be uncorrelated in P. aeruginosa., This work links experimental data of unprecedented complexity with evolution theory and delineates the transcriptional landscape of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that gene expression profiles are most strongly influenced by environmental cues, while at the same time the transcriptional profiles were also shaped considerably by genetic variation within global regulators. The comprehensive set of transcriptomic and genomic data of more than 150 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates will be made publically accessible to all researchers via a dedicated web interface. Both Pseudomonas specialists interested in expression and regulation of specific genes and researchers from other fields with more global interest in the phenotypic and genotypic variation of this important model species can access all information on various levels of detail.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4488947/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\JZNGNYUD\Dötsch et al. - 2015 - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa Transcriptional Landsca.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4488947/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-12 12:32:08</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barczak, Amy K.</author><author>Gomez, James E.</author><author>Kaufmann, Benjamin B.</author><author>Hinson, Ella R.</author><author>Cosimi, Lisa</author><author>Borowsky, Mark L.</author><author>Onderdonk, Andrew B.</author><author>Stanley, Sarah A.</author><author>Kaur, Devinder</author><author>Bryant, Kevin F.</author><author>Knipe, David M.</author><author>Sloutsky, Alexander</author><author>Hung, Deborah T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RNA signatures allow rapid identification of pathogens and antibiotic susceptibilities</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</abbr-1></periodical><pages>6217-6222</pages><volume>109</volume><number>16</number><issue>16</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-4-17</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1119540109</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With rising rates of drug-resistant infections, there is a need for diagnostic methods that rapidly can detect the presence of pathogens and reveal their susceptibility to antibiotics.

Although resistance to linezolid is an uncommon event, it has been reported in clinical isolates. The genome sequence of Streptococcus pneumoniae linezolid-resistant mutants recently revealed mutations associated with resistance. A proteomic and transcriptomic screen now reveals a possible increase in the metabolism and transport of carbohydrates in these linezolid-resistant S. pneumoniae mutants. Several glycolytic proteins were shown to be overexpressed in the resistant strains, along with other enzymes and transporters involved in the metabolism of sugars. An increase in energy needs appears to be required to sustain extended levels of resistance to linezolid as the disruption of two ABC transporters putatively involved in the import of carbohydrates leads to a 2-fold sensitization to linezolid. Furthermore, the disruption of the catabolite control protein A, a regulator of the metabolism of sugars whose expression is highly increased in one linezolid-resistant mutant, resulted in a 2-fold increase in linezolid susceptibility. This global scale analysis of gene and protein expression profiling highlights metabolism alterations associated with linezolid resistance in S. pneumoniae.</abstract><remote-database-name>ACS Publications</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1021/pr200221s</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\FF3GT9ZJ\Feng et al. - 2011 - Proteomic and Transcriptomic Analysis of Linezolid.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\7FIDTKCH\pr200221s.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-12 13:16:15</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blount, Zachary D.</author><author>Borland, Christina Z.</author><author>Lenski, Richard E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of Escherichia coli</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>PNAS</abbr-1></periodical><pages>7899-7906</pages><volume>105</volume><number>23</number><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>experimental evolution</keyword><keyword>adaptation</keyword><keyword>mutation</keyword><keyword>selection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008/06/10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424, 1091-6490</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.0803151105</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The role of historical contingency in evolution has been much debated, but rarely tested. Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for &gt;30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in experiments that “replayed” evolution from different points in that population's history. We observed no Cit+ mutants among 8.4 × 1012 ancestral cells, nor among 9 × 1012 cells from 60 clones sampled in the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of this phenotype was contingent on the particular history of that population. More generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/105/23/7899</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\RGGV6HCC\Blount et al. - 2008 - Historical contingency and the evolution of a key .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18524956</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\FKY8IDCN\7899.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-12 13:18:53</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guthrie, Violeta Beleva</author><author>Allen, Jennifer</author><author>Camps, Manel</author><author>Karchin, Rachel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Network Models of TEM β-Lactamase Mutations Coevolving under Antibiotic Selection Show Modular Structure and Anticipate Evolutionary Trajectories</title><secondary-title>PLOS Computational Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS Computational Biology</full-title><abbr-1>PLOS Computational Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e1002184</pages><volume>7</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Coevolution</keyword><keyword>Antibiotic resistance</keyword><keyword>Antibiotics</keyword><keyword>Centrality</keyword><keyword>Evolutionary adaptation</keyword><keyword>Evolutionary genetics</keyword><keyword>Mutation databases</keyword><keyword>Sequence databases</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>Sep 22, 2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1553-7358</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002184</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Understanding how novel functions evolve (genetic adaptation) is a critical goal of evolutionary biology. Among asexual organisms, genetic adaptation involves multiple mutations that frequently interact in a non-linear fashion (epistasis). Non-linear interactions pose a formidable challenge for the computational prediction of mutation effects. Here we use the recent evolution of β-lactamase under antibiotic selection as a model for genetic adaptation. We build a network of coevolving residues (possible functional interactions), in which nodes are mutant residue positions and links represent two positions found mutated together in the same sequence. Most often these pairs occur in the setting of more complex mutants. Focusing on extended-spectrum resistant sequences, we use network-theoretical tools to identify triple mutant trajectories of likely special significance for adaptation. We extrapolate evolutionary paths (n = 3) that increase resistance and that are longer than the units used to build the network (n = 2). These paths consist of a limited number of residue positions and are enriched for known triple mutant combinations that increase cefotaxime resistance. We find that the pairs of residues used to build the network frequently decrease resistance compared to their corresponding singlets. This is a surprising result, given that their coevolution suggests a selective advantage. Thus, β-lactamase adaptation is highly epistatic. Our method can identify triplets that increase resistance despite the underlying rugged fitness landscape and has the unique ability to make predictions by placing each mutant residue position in its functional context. Our approach requires only sequence information, sufficient genetic diversity, and discrete selective pressures. Thus, it can be used to analyze recent evolutionary events, where coevolution analysis methods that use phylogeny or statistical coupling are not possible. Improving our ability to assess evolutionary trajectories will help predict the evolution of clinically relevant genes and aid in protein design.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002184</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\7FQL4QV8\Guthrie et al. - 2011 - Network Models of TEM β-Lactamase Mutations Coevol.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\I2X4TWEA\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-12 13:19:41</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gong, Lizhi Ian</author><author>Suchard, Marc A.</author><author>Bloom, Jesse D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stability-mediated epistasis constrains the evolution of an influenza protein</title><secondary-title>eLife</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>eLife</full-title><abbr-1>eLife Sciences</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e00631</pages><volume>2</volume><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013/05/14</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2050-084X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.7554/eLife.00631</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Some of the mutations that occur during influenza evolution can only be tolerated in conjunction with other mutations that increase the stability of a viral protein.</abstract><remote-database-name>elifesciences.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://elifesciences.org/articles/00631</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\LQ6EETRF\Gong et al. - 2013 - Stability-mediated epistasis constrains the evolut.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\FLA4MJ54\00631.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-12 13:21:01</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Faith, Jeremiah J.</author><author>Hayete, Boris</author><author>Thaden, Joshua T.</author><author>Mogno, Ilaria</author><author>Wierzbowski, Jamey</author><author>Cottarel, Guillaume</author><author>Kasif, Simon</author><author>Collins, James J.</author><author>Gardner, Timothy S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Large-Scale Mapping and Validation of Escherichia coli Transcriptional Regulation from a Compendium of Expression Profiles</title><secondary-title>PLOS Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS Biology</full-title><abbr-1>PLOS Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e8</pages><volume>5</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Genetic networks</keyword><keyword>Gene regulation</keyword><keyword>Regulator genes</keyword><keyword>Sequence motif analysis</keyword><keyword>Microarrays</keyword><keyword>Transcription factors</keyword><keyword>Transcriptional control</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>Jan 9, 2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1545-7885</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pbio.0050008</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Machine learning approaches offer the potential to systematically identify transcriptional regulatory interactions from a compendium of microarray expression profiles. However, experimental validation of the performance of these methods at the genome scale has remained elusive. Here we assess the global performance of four existing classes of inference algorithms using 445 Escherichia coli Affymetrix arrays and 3,216 known E. coli regulatory interactions from RegulonDB. We also developed and applied the context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) algorithm, a novel extension of the relevance networks class of algorithms. CLR demonstrates an average precision gain of 36% relative to the next-best performing algorithm. At a 60% true positive rate, CLR identifies 1,079 regulatory interactions, of which 338 were in the previously known network and 741 were novel predictions. We tested the predicted interactions for three transcription factors with chromatin immunoprecipitation, confirming 21 novel interactions and verifying our RegulonDB-based performance estimates. CLR also identified a regulatory link providing central metabolic control of iron transport, which we confirmed with real-time quantitative PCR. The compendium of expression data compiled in this study, coupled with RegulonDB, provides a valuable model system for further improvement of network inference algorithms using experimental data.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050008</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6DU3NCH3\Faith et al. - 2007 - Large-Scale Mapping and Validation of Escherichia .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\HDCFJHFQ\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-13 16:44:07</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><titles><title>Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for childhood immunization--WHO position paper</title><secondary-title>Releve Epidemiologique Hebdomadaire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Releve Epidemiologique Hebdomadaire</full-title><abbr-1>Wkly.

The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups.

We explored PCV13's effect in reducing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD)–related morbidity and mortality, and whether serotype-specific changes were attributable to vaccination or expected as a part of natural, cyclical variations.Methods. This was a Danish nationwide population-based cohort study based on the linkage of laboratory surveillance data and the Danish Civil Registration System. Changes in IPD incidence and mortality during baseline (2000–2007), 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) (2008–2010), and PCV13 (2011–2013) periods were estimated. Predicted incidences of serotypes were estimated controlling for cyclical trends from historical patterns observed during the past 20 years.Results. We observed a 21% reduction (95% confidence interval [CI], 17%–25%) in IPD incidence in the total population after PCV13's introduction, and a 71% reduction (95% CI, 62%–79%) in children aged &amp;lt;2 years, considered as the vaccine effectiveness. We estimated a 28% reduction (95% CI, 18%–37%) in IPD-related 30-day mortality, from 3.4 deaths (95% CI, 3.2–3.6) per 100 000 population in the pre-PCV period to 2.4 (95% CI, 2.2–2.7) in the PCV13 period. The decline in mortality was observed across all age groups but was mainly related to mortality reductions in the nonvaccinated population. For serotypes 1 and 3, there were no significant changes in incidence beyond what would be expected from natural cyclical patterns. Serotype 19A significantly increased following PCV7's introduction, but the incidence declined toward baseline in 2012.Conclusions. PCV13 has brought greater benefits than we had expected in our setting. We observed a further decline on IPD incidence shortly after the shift from PCV7 to PCV13 in the national immunization program. This decline was accompanied by a substantial population-level decline in pneumococcal-related mortality of nearly 30% among nonvaccinated persons.</abstract><remote-database-name>academic.oup.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/59/8/1066/444898</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\IFQ2GZFA\Harboe et al. - 2014 - Impact of 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccina.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\VC9TFURW\444898.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-14 23:50:42</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Whitney, Cynthia G.</author><author>Farley, Monica M.</author><author>Hadler, James</author><author>Harrison, Lee H.</author><author>Bennett, Nancy M.</author><author>Lynfield, Ruth</author><author>Reingold, Arthur</author><author>Cieslak, Paul R.</author><author>Pilishvili, Tamara</author><author>Jackson, Delois</author><author>Facklam, Richard R.</author><author>Jorgensen, James H.</author><author>Schuchat, Anne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decline in Invasive Pneumococcal Disease after the Introduction of Protein–Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccine</title><secondary-title>New England Journal of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New England Journal of Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1737-1746</pages><volume>348</volume><number>18</number><issue>18</issue><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>May 1, 2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0028-4793</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMoa022823</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In 2000, a protein–polysaccharide pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was recommended for use in infants and young children.

Early changes demonstrate a reduction in vaccine serotypes and an increase in nonvaccine serotypes (NVT) among both carriage and invasive isolates. Ongoing surveillance is necessary to identify emerging invasive serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Enhanced surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease in Massachusetts began in October 2001 and remains ongoing. Isolates from children less than 5 are sent to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and subsequently to the Maxwell Finland laboratory for serotyping and determination of antimicrobial susceptibility. Annual incidence rates for vaccine serotype and NVT disease are calculated using 2000 census data. NVT caused 72%–91% of invasive pneumococcal disease annually in children less than 5 years of age between 2002 and 2005. Serotype 19A has emerged as the most frequent cause of IPD in Massachusetts. A multidrug-resistant clone (ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) (MLST 320) was first identified in Massachusetts in 2005. Three years after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for universal administration to children less than 2 in Massachusetts, a significant increase in invasive disease due to serotype 19A was observed. Although MLST 199 remains the most frequent sequence type among invasive isolates (of 19A), a multidrug-resistant sequence type, not previously identified in Massachusetts, has become an important cause of invasive disease. Further surveillance of the changing ecology of S. pneumoniae is necessary as a 4-year time period is not sufficient to fully evaluate the impact of PCV of pneumococcal infections.</abstract><remote-database-name>insights.ovid.com</remote-database-name><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=17529860</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/00006454-200706000-00003</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8V4MVRSW\pubmed.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-14 23:55:07</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>ABCs | Bacterial Surveillance | 2015 Strep Pneumoniae Report | CDC</title></titles><dates/><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.cdc.gov/abcs/reports-findings/survreports/spneu15.html</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\JVHUAWXR\spneu15.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 00:13:53</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lewis, Kim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Platforms for antibiotic discovery</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery</full-title></periodical><pages>371-387</pages><volume>12</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1474-1784</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrd3975</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The spread of resistant bacteria, leading to untreatable infections, is a major public health threat but the pace of antibiotic discovery to combat these pathogens has slowed down. Most antibiotics were originally isolated by screening soil-derived actinomycetes during the golden era of antibiotic discovery in the 1940s to 1960s. However, diminishing returns from this discovery platform led to its collapse, and efforts to create a new platform based on target-focused screening of large libraries of synthetic compounds failed, in part owing to the lack of penetration of such compounds through the bacterial envelope. This article considers strategies to re-establish viable platforms for antibiotic discovery. These include investigating untapped natural product sources such as uncultured bacteria, establishing rules of compound penetration to enable the development of synthetic antibiotics, developing species-specific antibiotics and identifying prodrugs that have the potential to eradicate dormant persisters, which are often responsible for hard-to-treat infections.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3975</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\WID5SWMA\Lewis - 2013 - Platforms for antibiotic discovery.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\A6GN8JSY\nrd3975.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 00:19:14</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fields, Francisco R.</author><author>Lee, Shaun W.</author><author>McConnell, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using bacterial genomes and essential genes for the development of new antibiotics</title><secondary-title>Biochemical Pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemical Pharmacology</full-title><abbr-1>Biochemical Pharmacology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>74-86</pages><volume>134</volume><keywords><keyword>Genomics</keyword><keyword>Antibiotic resistance</keyword><keyword>Antibiotic discovery</keyword><keyword>Bacteriocins</keyword><keyword>Essential genes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>June 15, 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0006-2952</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.bcp.2016.12.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The shrinking antibiotic development pipeline together with the global increase in antibiotic resistant infections requires that new molecules with antimicrobial activity are developed. Traditional empirical screening approaches of natural and non-natural compounds have identified the majority of antibiotics that are currently available, however this approach has produced relatively few new antibiotics over the last few decades. The vast amount of bacterial genome sequence information that has become available since the sequencing of the first bacterial genome more than 20years ago holds potential for contributing to the discovery of novel antimicrobial compounds. Comparative genomic approaches can identify genes that are highly conserved within and between bacterial species, and thus may represent genes that participate in key bacterial processes. Whole genome mutagenesis studies can also identify genes necessary for bacterial growth and survival under different environmental conditions, making them attractive targets for the development of novel inhibitory compounds. In addition, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches can be used to characterize RNA and protein levels on a cellular scale, providing information on bacterial physiology that can be applied to antibiotic target identification. Finally, bacterial genomes can be mined to identify biosynthetic pathways that produce many intrinsic antimicrobial compounds and peptides. In this review, we provide an overview of past and current efforts aimed at using bacterial genomic data in the discovery and development of novel antibiotics.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295216304634</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6M3CJSQW\Fields et al. - 2017 - Using bacterial genomes and essential genes for th.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\C2QADZGN\S0006295216304634.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 00:30:09</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Monk, Jonathan M.</author><author>Koza, Anna</author><author>Campodonico, Miguel A.</author><author>Machado, Daniel</author><author>Seoane, Jose Miguel</author><author>Palsson, Bernhard O.</author><author>Herrgård, Markus J.</author><author>Feist, Adam M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-omics Quantification of Species Variation of Escherichia coli Links Molecular Features with Strain Phenotypes</title><secondary-title>Cell Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Systems</full-title><abbr-1>cels</abbr-1></periodical><pages>238-251.e12</pages><volume>3</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Escherichia coli</keyword><keyword>systems biology</keyword><keyword>genome-scale modeling</keyword><keyword>metabolic engineering</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-09-28</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2405-4712</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cels.2016.08.013</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>www.cell.com</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cell.com/cell-systems/abstract/S2405-4712(16)30290-3</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\AGYNAGEQ\Monk et al. - 2016 - Multi-omics Quantification of Species Variation of.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27667363,%2027667363</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\F92L2LY6\S2405-4712(16)30290-3.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 00:40:46</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mack, Sean G.</author><author>Turner, Randi L.</author><author>Dwyer, Daniel J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Achieving a Predictive Understanding of Antimicrobial Stress Physiology through Systems Biology</title><secondary-title>Trends in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Trends in Microbiology</abbr-1></periodical><volume>0</volume><number>0</number><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>resistance</keyword><keyword>metabolic modeling</keyword><keyword>systems biology</keyword><keyword>antibiotics</keyword><keyword>antimicrobials</keyword><keyword>microbial physiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-03-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0966-842X, 1878-4380</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tim.2018.02.004</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>www.cell.com</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cell.com/trends/microbiology/abstract/S0966-842X(18)30027-1</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\GYK2U6XS\Mack et al. - 2018 - Achieving a Predictive Understanding of Antimicrob.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29530606,%2029530606</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\HGKDN495\S0966-842X(18)30027-1.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 00:56:10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Phillips, Patrick C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epistasis—the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems</title><secondary-title>Nature reviews.

Inviable double-mutant meiotic progeny identify functional relationships between genes. SGA analysis of genes with roles in cytoskeletal organization (BNI1,ARP2, ARC40, BIM1), DNA synthesis and repair (SGS1, RAD27), or uncharacterized functions (BBC1, NBP2) generated a network of 291 interactions among 204 genes.

Here, we studied system-level epistatic interactions by computing growth phenotypes of all single and double knockouts of 890 metabolic genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using the framework of flux balance analysis4. A new scale for epistasis identified a distinctive trimodal distribution of these epistatic effects, allowing gene pairs to be classified as buffering, aggravating or noninteracting2,5. We found that the ensuing epistatic interaction network6 could be organized hierarchically into function-enriched modules that interact with each other 'monochromatically' (i.e., with purely aggravating or purely buffering epistatic links). This property extends the concept of epistasis from single genes to functional units and provides a new definition of biological modularity, which emphasizes interactions between, rather than within, functional modules. Our approach can be used to infer functional gene modules from purely phenotypic epistasis measurements.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1489</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SJRYS6WY\ng1489.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 04:13:20</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lenski, Richard E.</author><author>Rose, Michael R.</author><author>Simpson, Suzanne C.</author><author>Tadler, Scott C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-Term Experimental Evolution in Escherichia coli.

In addition, we are concerned with the pattern of adaptation itself, particularly whether the rate of increase in mean fitness tends to decline with the number of generations of selection in a constant environment. The correspondence between the rate of increase in mean fitness and the within-population genetic variance of fitness, as expected from Fisher's fundamental theorem, is also addressed. Twelve Escherichia coli populations were founded from a single clonal ancestor and allowed to evolve for 2,000 generations. Mean fitness increased by about 37%. However, the rate of increase in mean fitness was slower in later generations. There was no statistically significant within-population genetic variance of fitness, but there was significant between-population variance. Although the estimated genetic variation in fitness within populations was not statistically significant, it was consistent in magnitude with theoretical expectations. Similarly, the variance of mean fitness between populations was consistent with a model that incorporated stochastic variation in the timing and order of substitutions at a finite number of nonepistatic loci, coupled with substitutional delays and interference between substitutions arising from clonality. These results, taken as a whole, are consistent with theoretical expectations that do not invoke divergence due to multiple fitness peaks in a Wrightian evolutionary landscape.</abstract><remote-database-name>JSTOR</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jstor.org/stable/2462549</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 04:18:58</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>Interplay in the Selection of Fluoroquinolone Resistance and Bacterial Fitness</title></titles><dates/><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000541</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\34BDFP2L\article.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 04:19:52</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Angst, Daniel C.</author><author>Hall, Alex R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The cost of antibiotic resistance depends on evolutionary history in Escherichia coli</title><secondary-title>BMC Evolutionary Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Evolutionary Biology</full-title><abbr-1>BMC Evolutionary Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>163</pages><volume>13</volume><keywords><keyword>Escherichia coli</keyword><keyword>Epistasis</keyword><keyword>Antibiotic resistance</keyword><keyword>Experimental evolution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>August 2, 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2148</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2148-13-163</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The persistence of antibiotic resistance depends on the fitness effects of resistance elements in the absence of antibiotics.

Epistasis (i.e. non-additive interaction between mutations that affect fitness) is a mechanism that can contribute to both scenarios. Epistasis can constrain the type and order of selected mutations, but it can also make adaptive trajectories contingent upon the first random substitution. This effect is particularly strong under sign epistasis, when the sign of the fitness effects of a mutation depends on its genetic background. In the current study, we examine how epistatic interactions between mutations determine alternative evolutionary pathways, using in vitro evolution of the antibiotic resistance enzyme TEM-1 β-lactamase. First, we describe the diversity of adaptive pathways among replicate lines during evolution for resistance to a novel antibiotic (cefotaxime). Consistent with the prediction of epistatic constraints, most lines increased resistance by acquiring three mutations in a fixed order. However, a few lines deviated from this pattern. Next, to test whether negative interactions between alternative initial substitutions drive this divergence, alleles containing initial substitutions from the deviating lines were evolved under identical conditions. Indeed, these alternative initial substitutions consistently led to lower adaptive peaks, involving more and other substitutions than those observed in the common pathway. We found that a combination of decreased enzymatic activity and lower folding cooperativity underlies negative sign epistasis in the clash between key mutations in the common and deviating lines (Gly238Ser and Arg164Ser, respectively). Our results demonstrate that epistasis contributes to contingency in protein evolution by amplifying the selective consequences of random mutations.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001321</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\T3TJFYF3\Salverda et al. - 2011 - Initial Mutations Direct Alternative Pathways of P.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\B3GGA5ZV\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 04:20:44</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rodríguez-Verdugo, Alejandra</author><author>Gaut, Brandon S.</author><author>Tenaillon, Olivier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolution of Escherichia coli rifampicin resistance in an antibiotic-free environment during thermal stress</title><secondary-title>BMC Evolutionary Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Evolutionary Biology</full-title><abbr-1>BMC Evolutionary Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>50</pages><volume>13</volume><keywords><keyword>Epistasis</keyword><keyword>Experimental evolution</keyword><keyword>Beneficial mutations</keyword><keyword>Fitness effects</keyword><keyword>Pleiotropy</keyword><keyword>Trade-offs</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>February 22, 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2148</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2148-13-50</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Beneficial mutations play an essential role in bacterial adaptation, yet little is known about their fitness effects across genetic backgrounds and environments. One prominent example of bacterial adaptation is antibiotic resistance. Until recently, the paradigm has been that antibiotic resistance is selected by the presence of antibiotics because resistant mutations confer fitness costs in antibiotic free environments. In this study we show that it is not always the case, documenting the selection and fixation of resistant mutations in populations of Escherichia coli B that had never been exposed to antibiotics but instead evolved for 2000 generations at high temperature (42.2°C).</abstract><research-notes>Pages 50 in PDF</research-notes><remote-database-name>BioMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-13-50</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8XXSFVM6\Rodríguez-Verdugo et al. - 2013 - Evolution of Escherichia coli rifampicin resistanc.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\J2EA5M4G\1471-2148-13-50.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 04:21:17</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tsuda, Masaki E.</author><author>Kawata, Masakado</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolution of Gene Regulatory Networks by Fluctuating Selection and Intrinsic Constraints</title><secondary-title>PLOS Computational Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS Computational Biology</full-title><abbr-1>PLOS Computational Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e1000873</pages><volume>6</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Evolutionary biology</keyword><keyword>Gene regulation</keyword><keyword>Gene expression</keyword><keyword>Organismal evolution</keyword><keyword>Evolutionary genetics</keyword><keyword>Deletion mutation</keyword><keyword>Gene duplication</keyword><keyword>Phenotypes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>Aug 5, 2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1553-7358</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000873</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Various characteristics of complex gene regulatory networks (GRNs) have been discovered during the last decade, e.g., redundancy, exponential indegree distributions, scale-free outdegree distributions, mutational robustness, and evolvability. Although progress has been made in this field, it is not well understood whether these characteristics are the direct products of selection or those of other evolutionary forces such as mutational biases and biophysical constraints. To elucidate the causal factors that promoted the evolution of complex GRNs, we examined the effect of fluctuating environmental selection and some intrinsic constraining factors on GRN evolution by using an individual-based model. We found that the evolution of complex GRNs is remarkably promoted by fixation of beneficial gene duplications under unpredictably fluctuating environmental conditions and that some internal factors inherent in organisms, such as mutational bias, gene expression costs, and constraints on expression dynamics, are also important for the evolution of GRNs. The results indicate that various biological properties observed in GRNs could evolve as a result of not only adaptation to unpredictable environmental changes but also non-adaptive processes owing to the properties of the organisms themselves. Our study emphasizes that evolutionary models considering such intrinsic constraining factors should be used as null models to analyze the effect of selection on GRN evolution.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000873</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\KK9JGIZE\Tsuda and Kawata - 2010 - Evolution of Gene Regulatory Networks by Fluctuati.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\T2T769MZ\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 04:47:11</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Janga, Sarath Chandra</author><author>Collado-Vides, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structure and evolution of gene regulatory networks in microbial genomes</title><secondary-title>Research in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Research in Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Research in Microbiology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>787-794</pages><volume>158</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Evolution</keyword><keyword>Gene regulatory networks</keyword><keyword>Prokaryotes</keyword><keyword>Protein–DNA interactions</keyword><keyword>Transcription</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>December 1, 2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0923-2508</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the availability of genome sequences for hundreds of microbial genomes, it has become possible to address several questions from a comparative perspective to understand the structure and function of regulatory systems, at least in model organisms.

It has been suggested that most, if not all, biological networks are 'scale free.' That is, their connections follow power-law distributions, such that there are very few nodes with very many connections and vice versa. The number of target genes of known transcriptional regulators in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, appears to follow such a distribution, as do other networks, such as the yeast network of protein-protein interactions. These findings have inspired attempts to draw biological inferences from general properties associated with scale-free network topology. One often cited general property is that, when compromised, highly connected nodes will tend to have a larger effect on network function than sparsely connected nodes. For example, more highly connected proteins are more likely to be lethal when knocked out. However, the correlation between lethality and connectivity is relatively weak, and some highly connected proteins can be removed without noticeable phenotypic effect. Similarly, network topology only weakly predicts the response of gene expression to environmental perturbations. Evolutionary simulations of gene-regulatory networks, presented here, suggest that such weak or non-existent correlations are to be expected, and are likely not due to inadequacy of experimental data. We argue that 'top-down' inferences of biological properties based on simple measures of network topology are of limited utility, and we present simulation results suggesting that much more detailed information about a gene's location in a regulatory network, as well as dynamic gene-expression data, are needed to make more meaningful functional and evolutionary predictions. Specifically, we find in our simulations that: (1) the relationship between a gene's connectivity and its fitness effect upon knockout depends on its equilibrium expression level; (2) correlation between connectivity and genetic variation is virtually non-existent, yet upon independent evolution of networks with identical topologies, some nodes exhibit consistently low or high polymorphism; and (3) certain genes show low polymorphism yet high divergence among independent evolutionary runs. This latter pattern is generally taken as a signature of positive selection, but in our simulations its cause is often neutral coevolution of regulatory inputs to the same gene.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16897451</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aldana, Maximino</author><author>Balleza, Enrique</author><author>Kauffman, Stuart</author><author>Resendiz, Osbaldo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Robustness and evolvability in genetic regulatory networks</title><secondary-title>Journal of Theoretical Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Theoretical Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Theoretical Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>433-448</pages><volume>245</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Gene duplication</keyword><keyword>Gene regulatory networks</keyword><keyword>Evolvability</keyword><keyword>Gene divergence</keyword><keyword>Robustness</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>April 7, 2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-5193</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.10.027</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Living organisms are robust to a great variety of genetic changes. Gene regulation networks and metabolic pathways self-organize and reaccommodate to make the organism perform with stability and reliability under many point mutations, gene duplications and gene deletions. At the same time, living organisms are evolvable, which means that these kind of genetic perturbations can eventually make the organism acquire new functions and adapt to new environments. It is still an open problem to determine how robustness and evolvability blend together at the genetic level to produce stable organisms that yet can change and evolve. Here we address this problem by studying the robustness and evolvability of the attractor landscape of genetic regulatory network models under the process of gene duplication followed by divergence. We show that an intrinsic property of this kind of networks is that, after the divergence of the parent and duplicate genes, with a high probability the previous phenotypes, encoded in the attractor landscape of the network, are preserved and new ones might appear. The above is true in a variety of network topologies and even for the case of extreme divergence in which the duplicate gene bears almost no relation with its parent. Our results indicate that networks operating close to the so-called “critical regime” exhibit the maximum robustness and evolvability simultaneously.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519306005170</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\B7BLP7ZL\Aldana et al. - 2007 - Robustness and evolvability in genetic regulatory .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\2KHFAR3L\S0022519306005170.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 05:13:08</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Babu, M Madan</author><author>Luscombe, Nicholas M</author><author>Aravind, L</author><author>Gerstein, Mark</author><author>Teichmann, Sarah A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structure and evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks</title><secondary-title>Current Opinion in Structural Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current Opinion in Structural Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Current Opinion in Structural Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>283-291</pages><volume>14</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>June 1, 2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0959-440X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.sbi.2004.05.004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The regulatory interactions between transcription factors and their target genes can be conceptualised as a directed graph. At a global level, these regulatory networks display a scale-free topology, indicating the presence of regulatory hubs. At a local level, substructures such as motifs and modules can be discerned in these networks. Despite the general organisational similarity of networks across the phylogenetic spectrum, there are interesting qualitative differences among the network components, such as the transcription factors. Although the DNA-binding domains of the transcription factors encoded by a given organism are drawn from a small set of ancient conserved superfamilies, their relative abundance often shows dramatic variation among different phylogenetic groups. Large portions of these networks appear to have evolved through extensive duplication of transcription factors and targets, often with inheritance of regulatory interactions from the ancestral gene. Interactions are conserved to varying degrees among genomes. Insights from the structure and evolution of these networks can be translated into predictions and used for engineering of the regulatory networks of different organisms.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X04000788</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\QHHDAMWF\Babu et al. - 2004 - Structure and evolution of transcriptional regulat.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NHFB5FSC\S0959440X04000788.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 05:14:11</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mobegi, Fredrick M.</author><author>Cremers, Amelieke J.

However, utilization of genome sequencing in clinical phenotyping of bacteria is challenging due to the lack of reliable and accurate approaches. Here, we report a method for predicting microbial resistance patterns using genome sequencing data. We analyzed whole genome sequences of 1,680 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from four independent populations using GWAS and identified probable hotspots of genetic variation which correlate with phenotypes of resistance to essential classes of antibiotics. With the premise that accumulation of putative resistance-conferring SNPs, potentially in combination with specific resistance genes, precedes full resistance, we retrogressively surveyed the hotspot loci and quantified the number of SNPs and/or genes, which if accumulated would confer full resistance to an otherwise susceptible strain. We name this approach the ‘distance to resistance’. It can be used to identify the creep towards complete antibiotics resistance in bacteria using genome sequencing. This approach serves as a basis for the development of future sequencing-based methods for predicting resistance profiles of bacterial strains in hospital microbiology and public health settings.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep42808</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\BLX433BL\Mobegi et al. - 2017 - Deciphering the distance to antibiotic resistance .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\M7R5ME4B\srep42808.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 05:40:01</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Palma, Susana I.

However, the tools to identify microbial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) discriminating between human pathogens are still missing. Artificial intelligence is increasingly recognised as an essential tool in health sciences. Machine learning algorithms based in support vector machines and features selection tools were here applied to find sets of microbial VOCs with pathogen-discrimination power. Studies reporting VOCs emitted by human microbial pathogens published between 1977 and 2016 were used as source data. A set of 18 VOCs is sufficient to predict the identity of 11 microbial pathogens with high accuracy (77%), and precision (62–100%). There is one set of VOCs associated with each of the 11 pathogens which can predict the presence of that pathogen in a sample with high accuracy and precision (86–90%). The implemented pathogen classification methodology supports future database updates to include new pathogen-VOC data, which will enrich the classifiers. The sets of VOCs identified potentiate the improvement of the selectivity of non-invasive infection diagnostics using artificial olfaction devices.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21544-1</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\LQTPZ5DJ\Palma et al. - 2018 - Machine learning for the meta-analyses of microbia.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\AD6G2ELD\s41598-018-21544-1.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 05:43:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, Marcus</author><author>Brettin, Thomas</author><author>Long, S.

Whole genome sequencing approaches to rapidly identify pathogens and predict antibiotic resistance phenotypes are becoming more feasible and may offer a way to reduce clinical test turnaround times compared to conventional culture-based methods, and in turn, improve patient outcomes. In this study, we use whole genome sequence data from 1668 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae to develop a XGBoost-based machine learning model that accurately predicts minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 20 antibiotics. The overall accuracy of the model, within ±1 two-fold dilution factor, is 92%. Individual accuracies are ≥90% for 15/20 antibiotics. We show that the MICs predicted by the model correlate with known antimicrobial resistance genes. Importantly, the genome-wide approach described in this study offers a way to predict MICs for isolates without knowledge of the underlying gene content. This study shows that machine learning can be used to build a complete in silico MIC prediction panel for K. pneumoniae and provides a framework for building MIC prediction models for other pathogenic bacteria.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18972-w</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\STYZIMUI\Nguyen et al. - 2018 - Developing an in silico minimum inhibitory concent.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8K52JVM9\s41598-017-18972-w.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-15 05:46:20</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Straume, Daniel</author><author>Stamsås, Gro Anita</author><author>Håvarstein, Leiv Sigve</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Natural transformation and genome evolution in Streptococcus pneumoniae</title><secondary-title>Infection, Genetics and Evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infection, Genetics and Evolution</full-title><abbr-1>Infection, Genetics and Evolution</abbr-1></periodical><pages>371-380</pages><volume>33</volume><keywords><keyword>Fratricide</keyword><keyword>Genome evolution</keyword><keyword>Natural genetic transformation</keyword><keyword>Penicillin resistance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>July 1, 2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1567-1348</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.meegid.2014.10.020</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Streptococcus pneumoniae is a frequent colonizer of the human nasopharynx that has the potential to cause severe infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis. Despite considerable efforts to reduce the burden of pneumococcal disease, it continues to be a major public health problem. After the Second World War, antimicrobial therapy was introduced to fight pneumococcal infections, followed by the first effective vaccines more than half a century later. These clinical interventions generated a selection pressure that drove the evolution of vaccine-escape mutants and strains that were highly resistant against antibiotics. The remarkable ability of S. pneumoniae to acquire drug resistance and evade vaccine pressure is due to its recombination-mediated genetic plasticity. S. pneumoniae is competent for natural genetic transformation, a property that enables the pneumococcus to acquire new traits by taking up naked DNA from the environment and incorporating it into its genome through homologous recombination. In the present paper, we review current knowledge on pneumococcal transformation, and discuss how the pneumococcus uses this mechanism to adapt and survive under adverse and fluctuating conditions.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134814003918</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\LRZYWBDQ\Straume et al. - 2015 - Natural transformation and genome evolution in Str.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\HRVV67DB\S1567134814003918.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-17 00:55:23</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thompson, Dawn</author><author>Regev, Aviv</author><author>Roy, Sushmita</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative Analysis of Gene Regulatory Networks: From Network Reconstruction to Evolution</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology</secondary-title><short-title>Comparative Analysis of Gene Regulatory Networks</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>399-428</pages><volume>31</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100913-012908</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Regulation of gene expression is central to many biological processes. Although reconstruction of regulatory circuits from genomic data alone is therefore desirable, this remains a major computational challenge. Comparative approaches that examine the conservation and divergence of circuits and their components across strains and species can help reconstruct circuits as well as provide insights into the evolution of gene regulatory processes and their adaptive contribution. In recent years, advances in genomic and computational tools have led to a wealth of methods for such analysis at the sequence, expression, pathway, module, and entire network level. Here, we review computational methods developed to study transcriptional regulatory networks using comparative genomics, from sequence to functional data. We highlight how these methods use evolutionary conservation and divergence to reliably detect regulatory components as well as estimate the extent and rate of divergence. Finally, we discuss the promise and open challenges in linking regulatory divergence to phenotypic divergence and adaptation.</abstract><remote-database-name>Annual Reviews</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100913-012908</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\2JBA4F8Q\Thompson et al. - 2015 - Comparative Analysis of Gene Regulatory Networks .pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-17 22:46:42</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>Reconstruction of the metabolic network of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to interrogate virulence factor synthesis | Nature Communications</title></titles><dates/><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14631#supplementary-information</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\JHPR22A4\ncomms14631.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-19 15:25:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ihmels, Jan</author><author>Bergmann, Sven</author><author>Gerami-Nejad, Maryam</author><author>Yanai, Itai</author><author>McClellan, Mark</author><author>Berman, Judith</author><author>Barkai, Naama</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rewiring of the Yeast Transcriptional Network Through the Evolution of Motif Usage</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>938-940</pages><volume>309</volume><number>5736</number><issue>5736</issue><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005/08/05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0036-8075, 1095-9203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1113833</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent experiments revealed large-scale differences in the transcription programs of related species, yet little is known about the genetic basis underlying the evolution of gene expression and its contribution to phenotypic diversity.

Taylor et al. mutated a central regulator for the formation of flagella in the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. They then put the mutated flagella-free bacteria under strong selection pressure to regain mobility. The mutated bacteria regained the lost flagella, and motility, within 4 days. Two stereotypical mutations diverted an evolutionarily related regulator that normally controls nitrogen uptake to control flagella biosynthesis. The mutations increased the levels of the co-opted regulator, then altered its specificity for the flagella pathway.&#xD;Science, this issue p. 1014&#xD;A central process in evolution is the recruitment of genes to regulatory networks. We engineered immotile strains of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens that lack flagella due to deletion of the regulatory gene fleQ. Under strong selection for motility, these bacteria consistently regained flagella within 96 hours via a two-step evolutionary pathway. Step 1 mutations increase intracellular levels of phosphorylated NtrC, a distant homolog of FleQ, which begins to commandeer control of the fleQ regulon at the cost of disrupting nitrogen uptake and assimilation. Step 2 is a switch-of-function mutation that redirects NtrC away from nitrogen uptake and toward its novel function as a flagellar regulator. Our results demonstrate that natural selection can rapidly rewire regulatory networks in very few, repeatable mutational steps.&#xD;Mutation of a bacterial flagellar regulator gene can be compensated for by changes in a related nitrogen uptake regulator.&#xD;Mutation of a bacterial flagellar regulator gene can be compensated for by changes in a related nitrogen uptake regulator.</abstract><remote-database-name>science.sciencemag.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6225/1014</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NFP8NBYC\Taylor et al. - 2015 - Evolutionary resurrection of flagellar motility vi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25722415</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\JE4GQBA5\1014.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-20 01:43:55</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Conant, Gavin C.</author><author>Wagner, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Convergent evolution of gene circuits</title><secondary-title>Nature Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>264-266</pages><volume>34</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1546-1718</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng1181</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Convergent evolution is a potent indicator of optimal design.

With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.springer.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>//www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387848570</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\DVQA6Y2G\9780387848570.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-20 02:30:44</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>A role for long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-4 (ACSL4) in diet-induced phospholipid remodeling and obesity-associated adipocyte dysfunction - Molecular Metabolism</title></titles><dates/><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.molmetab.com/article/S2212-8778(17)30962-6/abstract</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\GHQIFR2Z\abstract.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-21 02:29:39</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Killion, Elizabeth A.</author><author>Reeves, Andrew R.</author><author>El Azzouny, Mahmoud A.</author><author>Yan, Qing-Wu</author><author>Surujon, Defne</author><author>Griffin, John D.</author><author>Bowman, Thomas A.</author><author>Wang, Chunyan</author><author>Matthan, Nirupa R.</author><author>Klett, Eric L.</author><author>Kong, Dong</author><author>Newman, John W.</author><author>Han, Xianlin</author><author>Lee, Mi-Jeong</author><author>Coleman, Rosalind A.</author><author>Greenberg, Andrew S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A role for long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-4 (ACSL4) in diet-induced phospholipid remodeling and obesity-associated adipocyte dysfunction</title><secondary-title>Molecular Metabolism</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Metabolism</full-title></periodical><pages>43-56</pages><volume>9</volume><dates/><isbn>2212-8778</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.molmet.2018.01.012</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>doi: 10.1016/j.molmet.2018.01.012</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2018.01.012</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-21</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Landis, J.

This is particularly true for opportunistic pathogens that possess high intrinsic resistance. Though many studies have focused on understanding the acquisition of bacterial resistance upon exposure to antimicrobials, the mechanisms controlling intrinsic resistance are not well understood. In this study, we subjected the model opportunistic superbug Pseudomonas aeruginosa to 14 antimicrobials under highly controlled conditions and assessed its response using expression- and fitness-based genomic approaches. Our results reveal that gene expression changes and mutant fitness in response to sub-MIC antimicrobials do not correlate on a genomewide scale, indicating that gene expression is not a good predictor of fitness determinants. In general, fewer fitness determinants were identified for antiseptics and disinfectants than for antibiotics. Analysis of gene expression and fitness data together allowed the prediction of antagonistic interactions between antimicrobials and insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling these interactions.&#xD;IMPORTANCE Infections involving multidrug-resistant pathogens are difficult to treat because the therapeutic options are limited. These infections impose a significant financial burden on infected patients and on health care systems. Despite years of antimicrobial resistance research, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms controlling antimicrobial resistance. This work uses two fine-scale genomic approaches to identify genetic loci important for antimicrobial resistance of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results reveal that antibiotics have more resistance determinants than antiseptics/disinfectants and that gene expression upon exposure to antimicrobials is not a good predictor of these resistance determinants. In addition, we show that when used together, genomewide gene expression and fitness profiling can provide mechanistic insights into multidrug resistance mechanisms.</abstract><remote-database-name>mbio.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://mbio.asm.org/content/6/6/e01603-15</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\MRL4KYUR\Murray et al. - 2015 - Intrinsic Antimicrobial Resistance Determinants in.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26507235</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6M4ZTZUN\e01603-15.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-22 14:38:34</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bresler, Guy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficiently learning Ising models on arbitrary graphs</title><secondary-title>arXiv:1411.6156 [cs, math, stat]</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv:1411.6156 [cs, math, stat]</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Computer Science - Information Theory</keyword><keyword>Computer Science - Learning</keyword><keyword>Statistics - Machine Learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-11-22</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>We consider the problem of reconstructing the graph underlying an Ising model from i.i.d. samples. Over the last fifteen years this problem has been of significant interest in the statistics, machine learning, and statistical physics communities, and much of the effort has been directed towards finding algorithms with low computational cost for various restricted classes of models. Nevertheless, for learning Ising models on general graphs with $p$ nodes of degree at most $d$, it is not known whether or not it is possible to improve upon the $p^{d}$ computation needed to exhaustively search over all possible neighborhoods for each node. In this paper we show that a simple greedy procedure allows to learn the structure of an Ising model on an arbitrary bounded-degree graph in time on the order of $p^2$. We make no assumptions on the parameters except what is necessary for identifiability of the model, and in particular the results hold at low-temperatures as well as for highly non-uniform models. The proof rests on a new structural property of Ising models: we show that for any node there exists at least one neighbor with which it has a high mutual information. This structural property may be of independent interest.</abstract><research-notes>Comment: 20 pages</research-notes><remote-database-name>arXiv.org</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6156</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PC5TCVD9\Bresler - 2014 - Efficiently learning Ising models on arbitrary gra.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\38V9BR3G\1411.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-23 22:42:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ising, Ernst</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Beitrag zur Theorie des Ferromagnetismus</title><secondary-title>Zeitschrift für Physik</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zeitschrift für Physik</full-title><abbr-1>Z.

However, correlations are affected by both direct and indirect paths, confounding our ability to identify true pairwise interactions. Here we exploit the fundamental properties of dynamical correlations in networks to develop a method to silence indirect effects. The method receives as input the observed correlations between node pairs and uses a matrix transformation to turn the correlation matrix into a highly discriminative silenced matrix, which enhances only the terms associated with direct causal links. Against empirical data for Escherichia coli regulatory interactions, the method enhanced the discriminative power of the correlations by twofold, yielding &gt;50% predictive improvement over traditional correlation measures and 6% over mutual information. Overall this silencing method will help translate the abundant correlation data into insights about a system's interactions, with applications ranging from link prediction to inferring the dynamical mechanisms governing biological networks.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2601</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\7MWXEWG8\Barzel and Barabási - 2013 - Network link prediction by global silencing of ind.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\KW3UY6T2\nbt.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-23 23:02:05</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Bin</author><author>Horvath, Steve</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A General Framework for Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis</title><secondary-title>Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology</full-title></periodical><volume>4</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Microarrays</keyword><keyword>Clustering Coefficient</keyword><keyword>Hierarchical Organization</keyword><keyword>Module</keyword><keyword>Network Analysis</keyword><keyword>Scale-free Topology</keyword><keyword>Topological Overlap</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1544-6115</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2202/1544-6115.1128</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for `soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion).We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the `weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its `unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding.We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.</abstract><remote-database-name>DeGruyter</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/sagmb.2005.4.issue-1/sagmb.2005.4.1.1128/sagmb.2005.4.1.1128.xml</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\24GV5MZJ\Zhang and Horvath - 2005 - A General Framework for Weighted Gene Co-Expressio.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-24 03:01:48</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Palmer, Adam C.</author><author>Toprak, Erdal</author><author>Baym, Michael</author><author>Kim, Seungsoo</author><author>Veres, Adrian</author><author>Bershtein, Shimon</author><author>Kishony, Roy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Delayed commitment to evolutionary fate in antibiotic resistance fitness landscapes</title><secondary-title>Nature Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>7385</pages><volume>6</volume><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015-06-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2041-1723</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ncomms8385</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Predicting evolutionary paths to antibiotic resistance is key for understanding and controlling drug resistance.

Solving the architecture of such networks may provide valuable information, such as how microorganisms cause disease. Here we present a method (Tn-seq) for accurately determining quantitative genetic interactions on a genome-wide scale in microorganisms. Tn-seq is based on the assembly of a saturated Mariner transposon insertion library. After library selection, changes in frequency of each insertion mutant are determined by sequencing the flanking regions en masse. These changes are used to calculate each mutant's fitness. Using this approach, we determined fitness for each gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a causative agent of pneumonia and meningitis. A genome-wide screen for genetic interactions of five query genes identified both alleviating and aggravating interactions that could be divided into seven distinct categories. Owing to the wide activity of the Mariner transposon, Tn-seq has the potential to contribute to the exploration of complex pathways across many different species.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1377</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\RTJNJ52M\van Opijnen et al. - 2009 - Tn-seq high-throughput parallel sequencing for fi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\QSKHLVMW\nmeth.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-24 03:44:47</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scarselli, F.</author><author>Gori, M.</author><author>Tsoi, A.

In this paper, we propose a new neural network model, called graph neural network (GNN) model, that extends existing neural network methods for processing the data represented in graph domains. This GNN model, which can directly process most of the practically useful types of graphs, e.g., acyclic, cyclic, directed, and undirected, implements a function tau(G,n) isin IRm that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n into an m-dimensional Euclidean space. A supervised learning algorithm is derived to estimate the parameters of the proposed GNN model. The computational cost of the proposed algorithm is also considered. Some experimental results are shown to validate the proposed learning algorithm, and to demonstrate its generalization capabilities.</abstract><remote-database-name>IEEE Xplore</remote-database-name><urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\P5T2CFWD\Scarselli et al. - 2009 - The Graph Neural Network Model.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6JWT8XHI\4700287.html</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Zhuo</author><author>Danziger, Samuel A.</author><author>Heavner, Benjamin D.</author><author>Ma, Shuyi</author><author>Smith, Jennifer J.</author><author>Li, Song</author><author>Herricks, Thurston</author><author>Simeonidis, Evangelos</author><author>Baliga, Nitin S.</author><author>Aitchison, John D.</author><author>Price, Nathan D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combining inferred regulatory and reconstructed metabolic networks enhances phenotype prediction in yeast</title><secondary-title>PLOS Computational Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS Computational Biology</full-title><abbr-1>PLOS Computational Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e1005489</pages><volume>13</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</keyword><keyword>Gene regulation</keyword><keyword>Gene expression</keyword><keyword>Transcriptional control</keyword><keyword>Enzyme metabolism</keyword><keyword>Enzyme regulation</keyword><keyword>Metabolic networks</keyword><keyword>Yeast and fungal models</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>May 17, 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1553-7358</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005489</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Gene regulatory and metabolic network models have been used successfully in many organisms, but inherent differences between them make networks difficult to integrate. Probabilistic Regulation Of Metabolism (PROM) provides a partial solution, but it does not incorporate network inference and underperforms in eukaryotes. We present an Integrated Deduced And Metabolism (IDREAM) method that combines statistically inferred Environment and Gene Regulatory Influence Network (EGRIN) models with the PROM framework to create enhanced metabolic-regulatory network models. We used IDREAM to predict phenotypes and genetic interactions between transcription factors and genes encoding metabolic activities in the eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. IDREAM models contain many fewer interactions than PROM and yet produce significantly more accurate growth predictions. IDREAM consistently outperformed PROM using any of three popular yeast metabolic models and across three experimental growth conditions. Importantly, IDREAM’s enhanced accuracy makes it possible to identify subtle synthetic growth defects. With experimental validation, these novel genetic interactions involving the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex suggested a new role for fatty acid-responsive factor Oaf1 in regulating acetyl-CoA production in glucose grown cells.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005489</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\7GGGBDB7\Wang et al. - 2017 - Combining inferred regulatory and reconstructed me.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\QF9U6TL4\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-03-26 14:02:15</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Csardi, Gabor</author><author>Nepusz, Tamas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The igraph software package for complex network research</title></titles><pages>9</pages><dates/><remote-database-name>Zotero</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\B2MNMXI9\Csardi and Nepusz - The igraph software package for complex network re.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Novichkov, Pavel S.</author><author>Kazakov, Alexey E.</author><author>Ravcheev, Dmitry A.</author><author>Leyn, Semen A.</author><author>Kovaleva, Galina Y.</author><author>Sutormin, Roman A.</author><author>Kazanov, Marat D.</author><author>Riehl, William</author><author>Arkin, Adam P.</author><author>Dubchak, Inna</author><author>Rodionov, Dmitry A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RegPrecise 3.0 – A resource for genome-scale exploration of transcriptional regulation in bacteria</title><secondary-title>BMC Genomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Genomics</full-title><abbr-1>BMC Genomics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>745</pages><volume>14</volume><keywords><keyword>Bacteria</keyword><keyword>Comparative genomics</keyword><keyword>Regulatory network</keyword><keyword>Regulon</keyword><keyword>Riboswitch</keyword><keyword>Transcription factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>November 1, 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2164</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2164-14-745</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Genome-scale prediction of gene regulation and reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks in prokaryotes is one of the critical tasks of modern genomics.

In many experiments only one component of fitness is measured. In a previous study involving the diploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we measured the growth rate of 151 mutation-accumulation lines to estimate parameters of mutation. We found that an unexpectedly high frequency of fitness-altering mutations was beneficial. Here, we build upon our previous work by examining sporulation efficiency, spore viability, and haploid growth rate and find that these components of fitness also show a high frequency of beneficial mutations. We also examine whether mutation-acycumulation (MA) lines show any evidence of pleiotropy among accumulated mutations and find that, for most, there is none. However, MA lines that have zero fitness (i.e., lethality) for any one fitness component do show evidence for pleiotropy among accumulated mutations. We also report estimates of other parameters of mutation based on each component of fitness.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2927765/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ASY7TAE7\Hall and Joseph - 2010 - A High Frequency of Beneficial Mutations Across Mu.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2927765/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-04-15 21:52:40</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sokolova, Marina</author><author>Lapalme, Guy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A systematic analysis of performance measures for classification tasks</title><secondary-title>Information Processing &amp; Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Processing &amp; Management</full-title></periodical><pages>427-437</pages><volume>45</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>7/2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>03064573</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ipm.2009.03.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper presents a systematic analysis of twenty four performance measures used in the complete spectrum of Machine Learning classiﬁcation tasks, i.e., binary, multi-class, multi-labelled, and hierarchical. For each classiﬁcation task, the study relates a set of changes in a confusion matrix to speciﬁc characteristics of data. Then the analysis concentrates on the type of changes to a confusion matrix that do not change a measure, therefore, preserve a classiﬁer’s evaluation (measure invariance). The result is the measure invariance taxonomy with respect to all relevant label distribution changes in a classiﬁcation problem. This formal analysis is supported by examples of applications where invariance properties of measures lead to a more reliable evaluation of classiﬁers. Text classiﬁcation supplements the discussion with several case studies.</abstract><remote-database-name>CrossRef</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306457309000259</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8Z7W9R5D\Sokolova and Lapalme - 2009 - A systematic analysis of performance measures for .pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2018-04-15 23:34:46</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cohen, Jacob</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Coefficient of Agreement for Nominal Scales</title><secondary-title>Educational and Psychological Measurement</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Educational and Psychological Measurement</full-title><abbr-1>Educational and Psychological Measurement</abbr-1></periodical><pages>37-46</pages><volume>20</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1960</year><pub-dates><date>April 1, 1960</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0013-1644</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/001316446002000104</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>doi: 10.1177/001316446002000104</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1177/001316446002000104</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2018-04-15</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chawla, Nitesh V</author><author>Bowyer, Kevin W</author><author>Hall, Lawrence O</author><author>Kegelmeyer, W Philip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique</title></titles><pages>37</pages><dates/><abstract>An approach to the construction of classiﬁers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classiﬁcation categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classiﬁer to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classiﬁer performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classiﬁer performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classiﬁer. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.</abstract><remote-database-name>Zotero</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\CSPYRNWX\Chawla et al. - SMOTE Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aprianto, Rieza</author><author>Slager, Jelle</author><author>Holsappel, Siger</author><author>Veening, Jan-Willem</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Time-resolved dual RNA-seq reveals extensive rewiring of lung epithelial and pneumococcal transcriptomes during early infection</title><secondary-title>Genome Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Genome Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>198</pages><volume>17</volume><keywords><keyword>Streptococcus pneumoniae</keyword><keyword>Systems biology</keyword><keyword>Adherence</keyword><keyword>Competence</keyword><keyword>Dual RNA-seq</keyword><keyword>Host-microbe interaction</keyword><keyword>Lung epithelial cells</keyword><keyword>Transcriptomics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>September 27, 2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1474-760X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13059-016-1054-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Streptococcus pneumoniae, the pneumococcus, is the main etiological agent of pneumonia.

In Western populations, the treatment of lung infections is a primary driver of antibiotic resistance. Traditional therapeutic strategies have been based on the premise that the healthy lung is sterile and that infections grow in a pristine environment. As a consequence, rapid advances in our understanding of the composition of the microbiota of the skin and bowel have not yet been matched by studies of the respiratory tree. The recognition that the lungs are as populated with microorganisms as other mucosal surfaces provides the opportunity to reconsider the mechanisms and management of lung infections. Molecular analyses of the lung microbiota are revealing profound adverse responses to widespread antibiotic use, urbanization and globalization.

Conventional in vitro diagnostics for infectious diseases are time-consuming and require centralized laboratories, experienced personnel and bulky equipment. Recent advances in biosensor technologies have potential to deliver point-of-care diagnostics that match or surpass conventional standards in regards to time, accuracy and cost. Broadly classified as either label-free or labeled, modern biosensors exploit micro- and nanofabrication technologies and diverse sensing strategies including optical, electrical and mechanical transducers. Despite clinical need, translation of biosensors from research laboratories to clinical applications has remained limited to a few notable examples, such as the glucose sensor. Challenges to be overcome include sample preparation, matrix effects and system integration. We review the advances of biosensors for infectious disease diagnostics and discuss the critical challenges that need to be overcome in order to implement integrated diagnostic biosensors in real world settings.</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1586/14737159.2014.888313</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\BL5HR5PS\14737159.2014.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-04-23 21:34:08</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Warrier, Indu</author><author>Ram-Mohan, Nikhil</author><author>Zhu, Zeyu</author><author>Hazery, Ariana</author><author>Meyer, Michelle M.</author><author>Opijnen, Tim van</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Transcriptional landscape of Streptococcus pneumoniae reveals a complex operon architecture and abundant riboregulation critical for growth and virulence</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>286344</pages><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-03-21</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/286344</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Efficient and highly organized transcription initiation and termination is fundamental to an organism's ability to survive, proliferate, and quickly respond to its environment. Over the last decade, our simplistic outlook of bacterial transcriptional regulation and architecture has evolved to include stimulus-responsive regulation by untranslated RNA and the formation of alternate transcriptional units. In this study, we map the transcriptional landscape of the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae by applying a combination of high-throughput RNA-sequencing techniques. Our study reveals a complex transcriptome wherein environment-respondent alternate transcriptional units are observed within operons stemming from internal transcription start sites (TSS) and transcription terminators (TTS) suggesting that more fine-tuning of regulation occurs than previously thought. Additionally, we identify many putative cis-regulatory RNA elements and riboswitches within 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTR) of genes. By integrating TSSs and TTSs with independently collected RNA-Seq datasets from a variety of conditions, we establish the response of these regulators to changes in growth conditions and validate several of them. Furthermore, to determine the importance of ribo-regulation by 5'-UTR elements for in vivo virulence, we show that the pyrR regulatory element is essential for survival, successful colonization and infection in mice suggesting that such RNA elements are potential drug targets. Importantly, we show that our approach of combining high-throughput sequencing with in vivo experiments can reconstruct a global understanding of regulation, but also pave the way for discovery of compounds that target (ribo-)regulators to mitigate virulence and antibiotic resistance.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.biorxiv.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/21/286344</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ECBCCB6X\Warrier et al. - 2018 - The Transcriptional landscape of Streptococcus pne.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\QBJ7R8MA\286344.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-04-24 01:38:53</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kryazhimskiy, Sergey</author><author>Rice, Daniel P.</author><author>Jerison, Elizabeth R.</author><author>Desai, Michael M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global epistasis makes adaptation predictable despite sequence-level stochasticity</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1519-1522</pages><volume>344</volume><number>6191</number><issue>6191</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014/06/27</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0036-8075, 1095-9203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1250939</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Clouding evolution's crystal ball&#xD;Because of a sort of mutation buffering process, different starting mutations can tend to end up with similar overall affects on an organism's fitness. Kryazhimskiy et al. evolved lines of yeast, each originating from distinct single genotypes, under the same selective regimen. A subset of clones from these adapted populations was subjected to fitness assays and sequenced. Populations with lower initial fitness, adapted more rapidly than populations with higher initial fitness, so that in the end the fitness levels were similar.&#xD;Science, this issue p. 1519&#xD;Epistatic interactions between mutations can make evolutionary trajectories contingent on the chance occurrence of initial mutations. We used experimental evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to quantify this contingency, finding differences in adaptability among 64 closely related genotypes. Despite these differences, sequencing of 104 evolved clones showed that initial genotype did not constrain future mutational trajectories. Instead, reconstructed combinations of mutations revealed a pattern of diminishing-returns epistasis: Beneficial mutations have consistently smaller effects in fitter backgrounds. Taken together, these results show that beneficial mutations affecting a variety of biological processes are globally coupled; they interact strongly, but only through their combined effect on fitness. As a consequence, fitness evolution follows a predictable trajectory even though sequence-level adaptation is stochastic.&#xD;Epistasis makes fitness trajectories unpredictable in yeast, even as they converge upon the same biological pathway.&#xD;Epistasis makes fitness trajectories unpredictable in yeast, even as they converge upon the same biological pathway.</abstract><remote-database-name>science.sciencemag.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6191/1519</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\XLYQKH3U\Kryazhimskiy et al. - 2014 - Global epistasis makes adaptation predictable desp.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970088</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\YMULHX9U\tab-pdf.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-05-04 01:24:12</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Babu, M.

In such a network, TFs (transcription factors) and TGs (target genes) are represented as nodes and regulatory interactions between TFs and TGs are represented as directed links. In the present review, I address the following topics pertaining to transcriptional regulatory networks. (i) Structure and organization: first, I introduce the concept of networks and discuss our understanding of the structure and organization of transcriptional networks. (ii) Evolution: I then describe the different mechanisms and forces that influence network evolution and shape network structure. (iii) Dynamics: I discuss studies that have integrated information on dynamics such as mRNA abundance or half-life, with data on transcriptional network in order to elucidate general principles of regulatory network dynamics. In particular, I discuss how cell-to-cell variability in the expression level of TFs could permit differential utilization of the same underlying network by distinct members of a genetically identical cell population. Finally, I conclude by discussing open questions for future research and highlighting the implications for evolution, development, disease and applications such as genetic engineering.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.biochemsoctrans.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/content/38/5/1155</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\I5ASBL3A\Babu - 2010 - Structure, evolution and dynamics of transcription.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20863280</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\4TLD73XN\1155.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-05-04 03:30:44</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ciliberti, S.</author><author>Martin, O.

Very little is known about the principles of biological organization that allow such innovation. Here, we examine these principles for evolutionary innovation in gene expression patterns. To this end, we study a model for the transcriptional regulation networks that are at the heart of embryonic development. A genotype corresponds to a regulatory network of a given topology, and a phenotype corresponds to a steady-state gene expression pattern. Networks with the same phenotype form a connected graph in genotype space, where two networks are immediate neighbors if they differ by one regulatory interaction. We show that an evolutionary search on this graph can reach genotypes that are as different from each other as if they were chosen at random in genotype space, allowing evolutionary access to different kinds of innovation while staying close to a viable phenotype. Thus, although robustness to mutations may hinder innovation in the short term, we conclude that long-term innovation in gene expression patterns can only emerge in the presence of the robustness caused by connected genotype graphs.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/104/34/13591</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\MTCFJ4D4\Ciliberti et al. - 2007 - Innovation and robustness in complex regulatory ge.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17690244</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\Q9KLJPRG\13591.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-05-04 03:33:11</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Good, B.

Robert et al. used a single-cell technology to visualize the accumulation of new mutations. The method identifies DNA sequences with mispaired bases and small insertions or deletions caused by DNA replication errors in living Escherichia coli cells. Following the fates of cells after mutation allowed for a precise quantification of the effects of new mutations. A smaller fraction of mutations were found to be deleterious than predicted previously from indirect observations.&#xD;Science, this issue p. 1283&#xD;Mutations have been investigated for more than a century but remain difficult to observe directly in single cells, which limits the characterization of their dynamics and fitness effects. By combining microfluidics, time-lapse imaging, and a fluorescent tag of the mismatch repair system in Escherichia coli, we visualized the emergence of mutations in single cells, revealing Poissonian dynamics. Concomitantly, we tracked the growth and life span of single cells, accumulating ~20,000 mutations genome-wide over hundreds of generations.

We introduce a novel method based on the analyses of coexpression networks and Bayesian networks, and we use this new method to classify two types of hematological malignancies; namely, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Our classifier has an accuracy of 93%, a precision of 98%, and a recall of 90% on the training dataset (n = 366); which outperforms the results reported by other scholars on the same dataset. Although our training dataset consists of microarray data, our model has a remarkable performance on the RNA-Seq test dataset (n = 74, accuracy = 89%, precision = 88%, recall = 98%), which confirms that eigengenes are robust with respect to expression profiling technology. These signatures are useful in classification and correctly predicting the diagnosis. They might also provide valuable information about the underlying biology of diseases. Our network analysis approach is generalizable and can be useful for classifying other diseases based on gene expression profiles. Our previously published Pigengene package is publicly available through Bioconductor, which can be used to conveniently fit a Bayesian network to gene expression data.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24758-5</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NJLFIJEZ\Agrahari et al. - 2018 - Applications of Bayesian network models in predict.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\2KWJG3IQ\s41598-018-24758-5.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-05-13 20:18:07</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zaman, Naif</author><author>Li, Lei</author><author>Jaramillo, Maria Luz</author><author>Sun, Zhanpeng</author><author>Tibiche, Chabane</author><author>Banville, Myriam</author><author>Collins, Catherine</author><author>Trifiro, Mark</author><author>Paliouras, Miltiadis</author><author>Nantel, Andre</author><author>O’Connor-McCourt, Maureen</author><author>Wang, Edwin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Signaling Network Assessment of Mutations and Copy Number Variations Predict Breast Cancer Subtype-Specific Drug Targets</title><secondary-title>Cell Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Reports</full-title><abbr-1>Cell Reports</abbr-1></periodical><pages>216-223</pages><volume>5</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>October 17, 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2211-1247</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.celrep.2013.08.028</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Summary&#xD;Individual cancer cells carry a bewildering number of distinct genomic alterations (e.g., copy number variations and mutations), making it a challenge to uncover genomic-driven mechanisms governing tumorigenesis. Here, we performed exome sequencing on several breast cancer cell lines that represent two subtypes, luminal and basal. We integrated these sequencing data and functional RNAi screening data (for the identification of genes that are essential for cell proliferation and survival) onto a human signaling network. Two subtype-specific networks that potentially represent core-signaling mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis were identified. Within both networks, we found that genes were differentially affected in different cell lines; i.e., in some cell lines a gene was identified through RNAi screening, whereas in others it was genomically altered. Interestingly, we found that highly connected network genes could be used to correctly classify breast tumors into subtypes on the basis of genomic alterations. Further, the networks effectively predicted subtype-specific drug targets, which were experimentally validated.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124713004695</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NW5C33LX\Zaman et al. - 2013 - Signaling Network Assessment of Mutations and Copy.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\HBBFB24J\S2211124713004695.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-05-13 20:29:43</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weiser, Jeffrey N.</author><author>Ferreira, Daniela M.</author><author>Paton, James C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Streptococcus pneumoniae: transmission, colonization and invasion</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Microbiology</secondary-title><short-title>Streptococcus pneumoniae</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>355-367</pages><volume>16</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>6/2018</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1740-1526, 1740-1534</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41579-018-0001-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Streptococcus pneumoniae has a complex relationship with its obligate human host. On the one hand, the pneumococci are highly adapted commensals, and their main reservoir on the mucosal surface of the upper airways of carriers enables transmission. On the other hand, they can cause severe disease when bacterial and host factors allow them to invade essentially sterile sites, such as the middle ear spaces, lungs, bloodstream and meninges. Transmission, colonization and invasion depend on the remarkable ability of S. pneumoniae to evade or take advantage of the host inflammatory and immune responses. The different stages of pneumococcal carriage and disease have been investigated in detail in animal models and, more recently , in experimental human infection. Furthermore, widespread vaccination and the resulting immune pressure have shed light on pneumococcal population dynamics and pathogenesis. Here, we review the mechanistic insights provided by these studies on the multiple and varied interactions of the pneumococcus and its host.</abstract><remote-database-name>Crossref</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-018-0001-8</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\D9PJVEKW\Weiser et al. - 2018 - Streptococcus pneumoniae transmission, colonizati.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2018-05-15 16:56:16</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mathy, Charles</author><author>Derbinsky, Nate</author><author>Bento, José</author><author>Rosenthal, Jonathan</author><author>Yedidia, Jonathan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Boundary Forest Algorithm for Online Supervised and Unsupervised Learning</title><secondary-title>arXiv:1505.02867 [cs, stat]</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv:1505.02867 [cs, stat]</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Computer Science - Learning</keyword><keyword>Statistics - Machine Learning</keyword><keyword>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015-05-11</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>We describe a new instance-based learning algorithm called the Boundary Forest (BF) algorithm, that can be used for supervised and unsupervised learning. The algorithm builds a forest of trees whose nodes store previously seen examples. It can be shown data points one at a time and updates itself incrementally, hence it is naturally online. Few instance-based algorithms have this property while being simultaneously fast, which the BF is. This is crucial for applications where one needs to respond to input data in real time. The number of children of each node is not set beforehand but obtained from the training procedure, which makes the algorithm very flexible with regards to what data manifolds it can learn. We test its generalization performance and speed on a range of benchmark datasets and detail in which settings it outperforms the state of the art. Empirically we find that training time scales as O(DNlog(N)) and testing as O(Dlog(N)), where D is the dimensionality and N the amount of data,</abstract><research-notes>Comment: 7 pages, 4 figs, 1 page supp. info</research-notes><remote-database-name>arXiv.org</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02867</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\H4DTGLFH\Mathy et al. - 2015 - The Boundary Forest Algorithm for Online Supervise.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\RIQNHYDI\1505.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-05-25 18:06:45</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sievers, Fabian</author><author>Wilm, Andreas</author><author>Dineen, David</author><author>Gibson, Toby J.</author><author>Karplus, Kevin</author><author>Li, Weizhong</author><author>Lopez, Rodrigo</author><author>McWilliam, Hamish</author><author>Remmert, Michael</author><author>Söding, Johannes</author><author>Thompson, Julie D.</author><author>Higgins, Desmond G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fast, scalable generation of high‐quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega</title><secondary-title>Molecular Systems Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Systems Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>539</pages><volume>7</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>hidden Markov models</keyword><keyword>multiple sequence alignment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011/01/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1744-4292, 1744-4292</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/msb.2011.75</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Multiple sequence alignments are fundamental to many sequence analysis methods.

The RefSeq project leverages the data submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) against a combination of computation, manual curation, and collaboration to produce a standard set of stable, non-redundant reference sequences. The RefSeq project augments these reference sequences with current knowledge including publications, functional features and informative nomenclature. The database currently represents sequences from more than 55,000 organisms (&gt;4800 viruses, &gt;40,000 prokaryotes and &gt;10,000 eukaryotes; RefSeq release 71), ranging from a single record to complete genomes. This paper summarizes the current status of the viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic branches of the RefSeq project, reports on improvements to data access and details efforts to further expand the taxonomic representation of the collection. We also highlight diverse functional curation initiatives that support multiple uses of RefSeq data including taxonomic validation, genome annotation, comparative genomics, and clinical testing. We summarize our approach to utilizing available RNA-Seq and other data types in our manual curation process for vertebrate, plant, and other species, and describe a new direction for prokaryotic genomes and protein name management.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26553804</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Donati, Claudio</author><author>Hiller, N.

Bayesian model-based clustering is a powerful tool for detecting important patterns in such data and can be used to decipher even quite subtle signals of systematic differences in molecular variation. Here, we introduce two upgrades to the Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) software, which enable 1) spatially explicit modeling of variation in DNA sequences and 2) hierarchical clustering of DNA sequence data to reveal nested genetic population structures. We provide a direct interface to map the results from spatial clustering with Google Maps using the portal http://www.spatialepidemiology.net/ and illustrate this approach using sequence data from Borrelia burgdorferi. The usefulness of hierarchical clustering is demonstrated through an analysis of the metapopulation structure within a bacterial population experiencing a high level of local horizontal gene transfer.

Protein family classification can significantly contribute to the delineation of functional diversity of homologous proteins, the prediction of function based on domain architecture or the presence of sequence motifs as well as comparative genomics, providing valuable evolutionary insights. We present a novel approach called TRIBE-MCL for rapid and accurate clustering of protein sequences into families. The method relies on the Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm for the assignment of proteins into families based on precomputed sequence similarity information. This novel approach does not suffer from the problems that normally hinder other protein sequence clustering algorithms, such as the presence of multi-domain proteins, promiscuous domains and fragmented proteins. The method has been rigorously tested and validated on a number of very large databases, including SwissProt, InterPro, SCOP and the draft human genome. Our results indicate that the method is ideally suited to the rapid and accurate detection of protein families on a large scale. The method has been used to detect and categorise protein families within the draft human genome and the resulting families have been used to annotate a large proportion of human proteins.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11917018</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kristensen, David M.</author><author>Wolf, Yuri I.</author><author>Mushegian, Arcady R.</author><author>Koonin, Eugene V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Computational methods for Gene Orthology inference</title><secondary-title>Briefings in Bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Briefings in Bioinformatics</full-title><abbr-1>Brief Bioinform</abbr-1></periodical><pages>379-391</pages><volume>12</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-9</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1467-5463</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bib/bbr030</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Accurate inference of orthologous genes is a pre-requisite for most comparative genomics studies, and is also important for functional annotation of new genomes. Identification of orthologous gene sets typically involves phylogenetic tree analysis, heuristic algorithms based on sequence conservation, synteny analysis, or some combination of these approaches. The most direct tree-based methods typically rely on the comparison of an individual gene tree with a species tree. Once the two trees are accurately constructed, orthologs are straightforwardly identified by the definition of orthology as those homologs that are related by speciation, rather than gene duplication, at their most recent point of origin. Although ideal for the purpose of orthology identification in principle, phylogenetic trees are computationally expensive to construct for large numbers of genes and genomes, and they often contain errors, especially at large evolutionary distances. Moreover, in many organisms, in particular prokaryotes and viruses, evolution does not appear to have followed a simple ‘tree-like’ mode, which makes conventional tree reconciliation inapplicable. Other, heuristic methods identify probable orthologs as the closest homologous pairs or groups of genes in a set of organisms. These approaches are faster and easier to automate than tree-based methods, with efficient implementations provided by graph-theoretical algorithms enabling comparisons of thousands of genomes. Comparisons of these two approaches show that, despite conceptual differences, they produce similar sets of orthologs, especially at short evolutionary distances. Synteny also can aid in identification of orthologs. Often, tree-based, sequence similarity- and synteny-based approaches can be combined into flexible hybrid methods.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178053/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\N6DWSNUV\Kristensen et al. - 2011 - Computational methods for Gene Orthology inference.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178053/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-06-10 15:48:08</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Altenhoff, Adrian M.</author><author>Dessimoz, Christophe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phylogenetic and Functional Assessment of Orthologs Inference Projects and Methods</title><secondary-title>PLOS Computational Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS Computational Biology</full-title><abbr-1>PLOS Computational Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e1000262</pages><volume>5</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Comparative genomics</keyword><keyword>Genomic databases</keyword><keyword>Sequence alignment</keyword><keyword>Eukaryota</keyword><keyword>Gene ontologies</keyword><keyword>Phylogenetic analysis</keyword><keyword>Phylogenetics</keyword><keyword>Speciation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>Jan 16, 2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1553-7358</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000262</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Accurate genome-wide identification of orthologs is a central problem in comparative genomics, a fact reflected by the numerous orthology identification projects developed in recent years. However, only a few reports have compared their accuracy, and indeed, several recent efforts have not yet been systematically evaluated. Furthermore, orthology is typically only assessed in terms of function conservation, despite the phylogeny-based original definition of Fitch. We collected and mapped the results of nine leading orthology projects and methods (COG, KOG, Inparanoid, OrthoMCL, Ensembl Compara, Homologene, RoundUp, EggNOG, and OMA) and two standard methods (bidirectional best-hit and reciprocal smallest distance). We systematically compared their predictions with respect to both phylogeny and function, using six different tests. This required the mapping of millions of sequences, the handling of hundreds of millions of predicted pairs of orthologs, and the computation of tens of thousands of trees. In phylogenetic analysis or in functional analysis where high specificity is required, we find that OMA and Homologene perform best. At lower functional specificity but higher coverage level, OrthoMCL outperforms Ensembl Compara, and to a lesser extent Inparanoid. Lastly, the large coverage of the recent EggNOG can be of interest to build broad functional grouping, but the method is not specific enough for phylogenetic or detailed function analyses. In terms of general methodology, we observe that the more sophisticated tree reconstruction/reconciliation approach of Ensembl Compara was at times outperformed by pairwise comparison approaches, even in phylogenetic tests. Furthermore, we show that standard bidirectional best-hit often outperforms projects with more complex algorithms. First, the present study provides guidance for the broad community of orthology data users as to which database best suits their needs. Second, it introduces new methodology to verify orthology. And third, it sets performance standards for current and future approaches.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000262</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NM6E3N3C\Altenhoff and Dessimoz - 2009 - Phylogenetic and Functional Assessment of Ortholog.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\QEEIX6F7\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-06-10 18:35:54</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dagan, Tal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phylogenomic networks</title><secondary-title>Trends in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Trends in Microbiology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>483-491</pages><volume>19</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011-10-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0966-842X, 1878-4380</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tim.2011.07.001</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>www.cell.com</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.cell.com/trends/microbiology/abstract/S0966-842X(11)00138-7</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NA9AU445\Dagan - 2011 - Phylogenomic networks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21820313,%2021820313</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\5YQL7FQW\S0966-842X(11)00138-7.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-06-10 19:18:41</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Popa, Ovidiu</author><author>Hazkani-Covo, Einat</author><author>Landan, Giddy</author><author>Martin, William</author><author>Dagan, Tal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Directed networks reveal genomic barriers and DNA repair bypasses to lateral gene transfer among prokaryotes</title><secondary-title>Genome Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Research</full-title><abbr-1>Genome Res.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>599-609</pages><volume>21</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Computational Biology</keyword><keyword>DNA, Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid</keyword><keyword>Evolution, Molecular</keyword><keyword>Gene Transfer, Horizontal</keyword><keyword>DNA Repair</keyword><keyword>Genome</keyword><keyword>Base Composition</keyword><keyword>Prokaryotic Cells</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>Apr 2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1549-5469</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.115592.110</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Lateral gene transfer (LGT) plays a major role in prokaryote evolution with only a few genes that are resistant to it; yet the nature and magnitude of barriers to lateral transfer are still debated. Here, we implement directed networks to investigate donor-recipient events of recent lateral gene transfer among 657 sequenced prokaryote genomes. For 2,129,548 genes investigated, we detected 446,854 recent lateral gene transfer events through nucleotide pattern analysis. Among these, donor-recipient relationships could be specified through phylogenetic reconstruction for 7% of the pairs, yielding 32,028 polarized recent gene acquisition events, which constitute the edges of our directed networks. We find that the frequency of recent LGT is linearly correlated both with genome sequence similarity and with proteome similarity of donor-recipient pairs. Genome sequence similarity accounts for 25% of the variation in gene-transfer frequency, with proteome similarity adding only 1% to the variability explained. The range of donor-recipient GC content similarity within the network is extremely narrow, with 86% of the LGTs occurring between donor-recipient pairs having ≤5% difference in GC content. Hence, genome sequence similarity and GC content similarity are strong barriers to LGT in prokaryotes. But they are not insurmountable, as we detected 1530 recent transfers between distantly related genomes. The directed network revealed that recipient genomes of distant transfers encode proteins of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ; a DNA repair mechanism) far more frequently than the recipient lacking that mechanism. This implicates NHEJ in genes spread across distantly related prokaryotes through bypassing the donor-recipient sequence similarity barrier.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21270172</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dunphy, Laura J</author><author>Papin, Jason A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biomedical applications of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions of human pathogens</title><secondary-title>Current Opinion in Biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current Opinion in Biotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>70-79</pages><volume>51</volume><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>06/2018</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>09581669</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.copbio.2017.11.014</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>Crossref</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0958166917301544</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\55H645IF\Dunphy and Papin - 2018 - Biomedical applications of genome-scale metabolic .pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2018-07-17 13:40:46</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Santajit, Sirijan</author><author>Indrawattana, Nitaya</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Resistance in ESKAPE Pathogens</title><secondary-title>BioMed Research International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioMed Research International</full-title><abbr-1>Biomed Res Int</abbr-1></periodical><volume>2016</volume><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2314-6133</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2016/2475067</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) are the leading cause of nosocomial infections throughout the world.

Multidrug resistance is amongst the top three threats to global public health and is usually caused by excessive drug usage or prescription, inappropriate use of antimicrobials, and substandard pharmaceuticals. Understanding the resistance mechanisms of these bacteria is crucial for the development of novel antimicrobial agents or other alternative tools to combat these public health challenges.

An extreme negative or synthetic lethal genetic interaction occurs when two mutations, neither lethal individually, combine to cause cell death. Conversely, positive genetic interactions occur when two mutations produce a phenotype that is less severe than expected. Genetic interactions identify functional relationships between genes and can be harnessed for biological discovery and therapeutic target identification. They may also explain a considerable component of the undiscovered genetics associated with human diseases. Here, we describe construction and analysis of a comprehensive genetic interaction network for a eukaryotic cell.&#xD;RATIONALEGenome sequencing projects are providing an unprecedented view of genetic variation. However, our ability to interpret genetic information to predict inherited phenotypes remains limited, in large part due to the extensive buffering of genomes, making most individual eukaryotic genes dispensable for life. To explore the extent to which genetic interactions reveal cellular function and contribute to complex phenotypes, and to discover the general principles of genetic networks, we used automated yeast genetics to construct a global genetic interaction network.&#xD;RESULTSWe tested most of the ~6000 genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for all possible pairwise genetic interactions, identifying nearly 1 million interactions, including ~550,000 negative and ~350,000 positive interactions, spanning ~90% of all yeast genes. Essential genes were network hubs, displaying five times as many interactions as nonessential genes. The set of genetic interactions or the genetic interaction profile for a gene provides a quantitative measure of function, and a global network based on genetic interaction profile similarity revealed a hierarchy of modules reflecting the functional architecture of a cell. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections associated with defects in cell cycle progression or cellular proteostasis. Importantly, the global network illustrates how coherent sets of negative or positive genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathways to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.&#xD;CONCLUSIONA global genetic interaction network highlights the functional organization of a cell and provides a resource for predicting gene and pathway function. This network emphasizes the prevalence of genetic interactions and their potential to compound phenotypes associated with single mutations. Negative genetic interactions tend to connect functionally related genes and thus may be predicted using alternative functional information. Although less functionally informative, positive interactions may provide insights into general mechanisms of genetic suppression or resiliency. We anticipate that the ordered topology of the global genetic network, in which genetic interactions connect coherently within and between protein complexes and pathways, may be exploited to decipher genotype-to-phenotype relationships.

(Right) Spatial analysis of functional enrichment was used to identify and color network regions enriched for similar Gene Ontology bioprocess terms.&#xD;We generated a global genetic interaction network for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive network maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how coherent sets of genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.</abstract><remote-database-name>science.sciencemag.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6306/aaf1420</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\AW8HUE4I\Costanzo et al. - 2016 - A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27708008</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\G7M2YXEZ\aaf1420.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-07-23 23:06:10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aldred, Katie&#xD;J.</author><author>Kerns, Robert J.</author><author>Osheroff, Neil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanism of Quinolone Action and Resistance</title><secondary-title>Biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biochemistry</full-title><abbr-1>Biochemistry</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1565-1574</pages><volume>53</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-03-18</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0006-2960</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/bi5000564</electronic-resource-num><abstract>, Quinolones&#xD;are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of antibacterials&#xD;in the world and are used to treat a variety of bacterial infections&#xD;in humans. Because of the wide use (and overuse) of these drugs, the&#xD;number of quinolone-resistant bacterial strains has been growing steadily&#xD;since the 1990s. As is the case with other antibacterial agents, the&#xD;rise in quinolone resistance threatens the clinical utility of this&#xD;important drug class. Quinolones act by converting their targets,&#xD;gyrase and topoisomerase IV, into toxic enzymes that fragment the&#xD;bacterial chromosome. This review describes the development of the&#xD;quinolones as antibacterials, the structure and function of gyrase&#xD;and topoisomerase IV, and the mechanistic basis for quinolone action&#xD;against their enzyme targets. It will then discuss the following three&#xD;mechanisms that decrease the sensitivity of bacterial cells to quinolones.&#xD;Target-mediated resistance is the most common and clinically significant&#xD;form of resistance. It is caused by specific mutations in gyrase and&#xD;topoisomerase IV that weaken interactions between quinolones and these&#xD;enzymes. Plasmid-mediated resistance results from extrachromosomal&#xD;elements that encode proteins that disrupt quinolone–enzyme&#xD;interactions, alter drug metabolism, or increase quinolone efflux.&#xD;Chromosome-mediated resistance results from the underexpression of&#xD;porins or the overexpression of cellular efflux pumps, both of which&#xD;decrease cellular concentrations of quinolones. Finally, this review&#xD;will discuss recent advancements in our understanding of how quinolones&#xD;interact with gyrase and topoisomerase IV and how mutations in these&#xD;enzymes cause resistance. These last findings suggest approaches to&#xD;designing new drugs that display improved activity against resistant&#xD;strains.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985860/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3N8V4N3E\Aldred et al. - 2014 - Mechanism of Quinolone Action and Resistance.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985860/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-08-01 00:24:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horng, Yu-Tze</author><author>Jeng, Wen-Yih</author><author>Chen, Yih-Yuan</author><author>Liu, Che-Hung</author><author>Dou, Horng-Yunn</author><author>Lee, Jen-Jyh</author><author>Chang, Kai-Chih</author><author>Chien, Chih-Ching</author><author>Soo, Po-Chi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular Analysis of Codon 548 in the rpoB Gene Involved in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Resistance to Rifampin</title><secondary-title>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</full-title><abbr-1>Antimicrob Agents Chemother</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1542-1548</pages><volume>59</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015-3</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0066-4804</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/AAC.04374-14</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Most Mycobacterium tuberculosis rifampin-resistant strains have been associated with mutations in an 81-bp rifampin resistance-determining region (RRDR) in the gene rpoB. However, if this region alone were targeted, rifampin-resistant strains with mutations outside the RRDR would not be detected. In this study, among 51 rifampin-resistant clinical isolates analyzed by sequencing 1,681-bp-long DNA fragments containing the RRDR, 47 isolates contained mutations within the RRDR, three isolates contained mutations both within and outside the RRDR, and only one isolate had a single missense mutation (Arg548His) located outside the RRDR. A drug susceptibility test of recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. tuberculosis isolates carrying mutated rpoB (Arg548His) showed an increased MIC for rifampin compared to that of the control strains. Modeling of the Arg548His mutant RpoB-DNA complex revealed that the His548 side chain formed a more stable hydrogen bond structure than did Arg548, reducing the flexibility of the rifampin-resistant cluster II region of RpoB, suggesting that the RpoB Arg548His mutant does not effectively interact with rifampin and results in bacterial resistance to the drug. This is the first report on the relationship between the mutation in codon 548 of RpoB and rifampin resistance in tuberculosis. The novel mutational profile of the rpoB gene described here will contribute to the comprehensive understanding of rifampin resistance patterns and to the development of a useful tool for simple and rapid drug susceptibility tests.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4325785/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\AAHGVXZQ\Horng et al. - 2015 - Molecular Analysis of Codon 548 in the rpoB Gene I.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4325785/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-08-01 00:26:16</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weldhagen, Gerhard F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrons and beta-lactamases--a novel perspective on resistance</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents</full-title><abbr-1>Int.

Integron-borne beta-lactamases co-occurring with a wide array of non-beta-lactam resistance genes, particularly pose an increasing threat to the nosocomial environment, giving rise to multi-drug resistant microbes with complex resistance patterns. Selection of potent beta-lactamases through the use of non-beta-lactam agents may be possible through integron-mediated resistance. It has become imperative that we should continuously strive to understand these complex mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, not only to overcome them, but to avoid them from evolving further.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15194125</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lampson, B.

This 26.5-kilobase plasmid encodes resistance strictly to 14-membered macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin, and oleandomycin. Resistance to other macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics was not observed even after a prior induction stimulus with various MLS antibiotics. Plasmid pNE24 was found to express resistance constitutively and manifested a low to intermediate MIC (62.5 micrograms/ml) for erythromycin. The resistance gene, designated erpA, appears to mediate resistance by altering the permeability of the host cell for erythromycin, because the measured uptake of 14C-labeled erythromycin by strain 958-2 (containing pNE24) was lower than for the erythromycin-susceptible, isogenic strain 958-1. No inactivation of erythromycin in overnight broth culture supernatants could be detected. In addition, no significant loss in binding affinity between [14C]erythromycin and ribosome could be detected for ribosomes isolated from strain 958-2 relative to 958-1, indicating that pNE24 probably does not produce a modification of the bacterial ribosome. No other selectable marker was found associated with pNE24; however, a 60,000-dalton protein was present only in the membrane fractions of cells (958-2) containing pNE24 and may play a role in mediating resistance to erythromycin.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3800341</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Slager, Jelle</author><author>Kjos, Morten</author><author>Attaiech, Laetitia</author><author>Veening, Jan-Willem</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antibiotic-induced replication stress triggers bacterial competence by increasing gene dosage near the origin</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title><abbr-1>Cell</abbr-1></periodical><pages>395-406</pages><volume>157</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Bacteria</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial</keyword><keyword>Bacterial Physiological Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Anti-Bacterial Agents</keyword><keyword>Streptococcus pneumoniae</keyword><keyword>DNA Replication</keyword><keyword>DNA Transformation Competence</keyword><keyword>Gene Dosage</keyword><keyword>Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors</keyword><keyword>Replication Origin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>Apr 10, 2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1097-4172</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.068</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) kills nearly 1 million children annually, and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains poses a serious threat to human health. Because pneumococci can take up DNA from their environment by a process called competence, genes associated with antibiotic resistance can rapidly spread. Remarkably, competence is activated in response to several antibiotics. Here, we demonstrate that antibiotics targeting DNA replication cause an increase in the copy number of genes proximal to the origin of replication (oriC). As the genes required for competence initiation are located near oriC, competence is thereby activated. Transcriptome analyses show that antibiotics targeting DNA replication also upregulate origin-proximal gene expression in other bacteria. This mechanism is a direct, intrinsic consequence of replication fork stalling. Our data suggest that evolution has conserved the oriC-proximal location of important genes in bacteria to allow for a robust response to replication stress without the need for complex gene-regulatory pathways.

We investigated the role of mutations in the embC-embA intergenic region (IGR) in EMB-resistant clinical strains from east China. A total of 767 M. tuberculosis clinical strains were collected and analyzed for their drug susceptibility to EMB using the MGIT 960 system and MIC assay, and the embC-embA IGRs of these strains were sequenced. The transcriptional activity of the embC-embA IGR mutations was examined by reporter gene assays in recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis strains, and the effect of IGR mutations on its binding to EmbR, a transcription regulator of embAB, was analyzed by gel mobility shift assays. Correlation coefficient analysis showed that the embC-embA IGR mutation is associated with EMB resistance. The clinical strains carrying IGR mutations had a much higher level of embA and embB mRNA as well as higher MICs to EMB. IGR mutations had higher transcriptional activity when transformed into M. smegmatis strains. Mutated IGRs bound to EmbR with much higher affinity than wild-type fragments. The sensitivity of molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST) with IGR mutations as an additional marker increased from 65.5% to 73.5%. Mutations of the embC-embA IGR enhance the binding of EmbR to the promoter region of embAB and increase the expression of embAB, thus contributing to EMB resistance. Therefore, identification of IGR mutations as markers of EMB resistance could increase the sensitivity of molecular DST.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25182646</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>The post-vaccine microevolution of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae | Scientific Reports</title></titles><dates/><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14952</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\YB3JSAS3\srep14952.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-08-15 17:28:05</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cremers, Amelieke J.

The RefSeq project leverages the data submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) against a combination of computation, manual curation, and collaboration to produce a standard set of stable, non-redundant reference sequences. The RefSeq project augments these reference sequences with current knowledge including publications, functional features and informative nomenclature. The database currently represents sequences from more than 55,000 organisms (&gt;4800 viruses, &gt;40,000 prokaryotes and &gt;10,000 eukaryotes; RefSeq release 71), ranging from a single record to complete genomes. This paper summarizes the current status of the viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic branches of the RefSeq project, reports on improvements to data access and details efforts to further expand the taxonomic representation of the collection. We also highlight diverse functional curation initiatives that support multiple uses of RefSeq data including taxonomic validation, genome annotation, comparative genomics, and clinical testing. We summarize our approach to utilizing available RNA-Seq and other data types in our manual curation process for vertebrate, plant, and other species, and describe a new direction for prokaryotic genomes and protein name management.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26553804</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chewapreecha, Claire</author><author>Harris, Simon R</author><author>Croucher, Nicholas J</author><author>Turner, Claudia</author><author>Marttinen, Pekka</author><author>Cheng, Lu</author><author>Pessia, Alberto</author><author>Aanensen, David M</author><author>Mather, Alison E</author><author>Page, Andrew J</author><author>Salter, Susannah J.</author><author>Harris, David</author><author>Nosten, Francois</author><author>Goldblatt, David</author><author>Corander, Jukka</author><author>Parkhill, Julian</author><author>Turner, Paul</author><author>Bentley, Stephen D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dense genomic sampling identifies highways of pneumococcal recombination</title><secondary-title>Nature genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature genetics</full-title><abbr-1>Nat Genet</abbr-1></periodical><pages>305-309</pages><volume>46</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-3</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1061-4036</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng.2895</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Evasion of clinical interventions by Streptococcus pneumoniae occurs through selection of non-susceptible genomic variants.

Genomic recombination hotspots show remarkable consistency between lineages, indicating common selective pressures acting at certain loci, particularly those associated with antibiotic resistance. Temporal changes in antibiotic consumption are reflected in changes in recombination trends demonstrating rapid spread of resistance when selective pressure is high. The highest frequencies of receipt and donation of recombined DNA fragments were observed in non-encapsulated lineages, implying that this largely overlooked pneumococcal group, which is beyond the reach of current vaccines, may play a major role in genetic exchange and adaptation of the species as a whole.

To address this risk, they receive pneumococcal vaccines, and antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment. To assess the impact of SCD and these interventions on pneumococcal genetic architecture, we examined the genomes of more than 300 pneumococcal isolates from SCD patients over 20 years. Modern SCD strains retained invasive capacity but shifted away from the serotypes used in vaccines. These strains had speciﬁc genetic changes related to antibiotic resistance, capsule biosynthesis, metabolism, and metal transport. A murine SCD model coupled with Tn-seq mutagenesis identiﬁed 60 noncapsular pneumococcal genes under differential selective pressure in SCD, which correlated with aspects of SCD pathophysiology. Further, virulence determinants in the SCD context were distinct from the general population, and protective capacity of potential antigens was lost over time in SCD. This highlights the importance of understanding bacterial pathogenesis in the context of high-risk individuals.</abstract><remote-database-name>Crossref</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1931312814001395</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\4TCRFGZU\Carter et al. - 2014 - Genomic Analyses of Pneumococci from Children with.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2018-08-15 17:50:18</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ding, Wei</author><author>Baumdicker, Franz</author><author>Neher, Richard A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>panX: pan-genome analysis and exploration</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acids Research</secondary-title><short-title>panX</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic Acids Research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucleic Acids Res</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e5</pages><volume>46</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-1-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0305-1048</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkx977</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Horizontal transfer, gene loss, and duplication result in dynamic bacterial genomes shaped by a complex mixture of different modes of evolution. Closely related strains can differ in the presence or absence of many genes, and the total number of distinct genes found in a set of related isolates—the pan-genome—is often many times larger than the genome of individual isolates. We have developed a pipeline that efficiently identifies orthologous gene clusters in the pan-genome. This pipeline is coupled to a powerful yet easy-to-use web-based visualization for interactive exploration of the pan-genome. The visualization consists of connected components that allow rapid filtering and searching of genes and inspection of their evolutionary history. For each gene cluster, panX displays an alignment, a phylogenetic tree, maps mutations within that cluster to the branches of the tree and infers gain and loss of genes on the core-genome phylogeny. PanX is available at pangenome.de. Custom pan-genomes can be visualized either using a web server or by serving panX locally as a browser-based application.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5758898/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ILQGTE4Y\Ding et al. - 2018 - panX pan-genome analysis and exploration.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5758898/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-08-15 20:04:32</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bush, Robin M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting adaptive evolution</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>387-392</pages><volume>2</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001-05</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/35072023</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Phylogenetic trees reconstruct past evolution and can provide evidence of past evolutionary pressure on genes and on individual codons.

Four different hypotheses have been proposed to explain this high degree of polymorphism: (1) a high mutation rate2, (2) gene conversion or interlocus genetic exchange3–5, (3) over dominant selection6,7 and (4) frequency-dependent selection8,9. In an attempt to establish which of these hypotheses is correct, we examined the pattern of nucleotide substitution between polymorphic alleles in the region of the antigen recognition site (ARS)10,11 and other regions of human and mouse class I MHC genes. The results indicate that in ARS the rate of nonsynonymous (amino acid altering) substitution is significantly higher than that of synonymous substitution in both humans and mice, whereas in other regions the reverse is true. This observation, together with a theoretical study12 and other considerations, supports the hypothesis of overdominant selection (heterozygote advantage).</abstract><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/335167a0</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\XBZI7H4F\335167a0.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-08-24 18:38:34</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khan, Aisha I.</author><author>Dinh, Duy M.</author><author>Schneider, Dominique</author><author>Lenski, Richard E.</author><author>Cooper, Tim F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Negative Epistasis Between Beneficial Mutations in an Evolving Bacterial Population</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1193-1196</pages><volume>332</volume><number>6034</number><issue>6034</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011/06/03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0036-8075, 1095-9203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1203801</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Epistatic interactions between mutations play a prominent role in evolutionary theories. Many studies have found that epistasis is widespread, but they have rarely considered beneficial mutations. We analyzed the effects of epistasis on fitness for the first five mutations to fix in an experimental population of Escherichia coli. Epistasis depended on the effects of the combined mutations—the larger the expected benefit, the more negative the epistatic effect. Epistasis thus tended to produce diminishing returns with genotype fitness, although interactions involving one particular mutation had the opposite effect. These data support models in which negative epistasis contributes to declining rates of adaptation over time. Sign epistasis was rare in this genome-wide study, in contrast to its prevalence in an earlier study of mutations in a single gene.&#xD;Interactions between genes reduce the benefits of a mutation and decrease the rate of fitness gain during adaptation.&#xD;Interactions between genes reduce the benefits of a mutation and decrease the rate of fitness gain during adaptation.</abstract><remote-database-name>science.sciencemag.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6034/1193</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3QJZS43F\Khan et al. - 2011 - Negative Epistasis Between Beneficial Mutations in.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21636772</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\YKKG9C37\1193.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-08-24 20:25:37</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roguev, Assen</author><author>Bandyopadhyay, Sourav</author><author>Zofall, Martin</author><author>Zhang, Ke</author><author>Fischer, Tamas</author><author>Collins, Sean R.</author><author>Qu, Hongjing</author><author>Shales, Michael</author><author>Park, Han-Oh</author><author>Hayles, Jacqueline</author><author>Hoe, Kwang-Lae</author><author>Kim, Dong-Uk</author><author>Ideker, Trey</author><author>Grewal, Shiv I.</author><author>Weissman, Jonathan S.</author><author>Krogan, Nevan J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conservation and Rewiring of Functional Modules Revealed by an Epistasis Map in Fission Yeast</title><secondary-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science (New York, N.Y.)</full-title><abbr-1>Science</abbr-1></periodical><pages>405-410</pages><volume>322</volume><number>5900</number><issue>5900</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-10-17</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0036-8075</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1162609</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An epistasis map (E-MAP) was constructed in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, by systematically measuring the phenotypes associated with pairs of mutations. This high-density, quantitative genetic interaction map focused on various aspects of chromosome function, including transcription regulation and DNA repair/replication. The E-MAP uncovered a previously unidentified component of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery (rsh1) and linked the RNAi pathway to several other biological processes. Comparison of the S. pombe E-MAP to an analogous genetic map from the budding yeast revealed that, whereas negative interactions were conserved between genes involved in similar biological processes, positive interactions and overall genetic profiles between pairs of genes coding for physically associated proteins were even more conserved. Hence, conservation occurs at the level of the functional module (protein complex), but the genetic cross talk between modules can differ substantially.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2753251/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\4T8KL66K\Roguev et al. - 2008 - Conservation and Rewiring of Functional Modules Re.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2753251/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-08-24 20:40:06</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tong, Amy Hin Yan</author><author>Lesage, Guillaume</author><author>Bader, Gary D.</author><author>Ding, Huiming</author><author>Xu, Hong</author><author>Xin, Xiaofeng</author><author>Young, James</author><author>Berriz, Gabriel F.</author><author>Brost, Renee L.</author><author>Chang, Michael</author><author>Chen, YiQun</author><author>Cheng, Xin</author><author>Chua, Gordon</author><author>Friesen, Helena</author><author>Goldberg, Debra S.</author><author>Haynes, Jennifer</author><author>Humphries, Christine</author><author>He, Grace</author><author>Hussein, Shamiza</author><author>Ke, Lizhu</author><author>Krogan, Nevan</author><author>Li, Zhijian</author><author>Levinson, Joshua N.</author><author>Lu, Hong</author><author>Ménard, Patrice</author><author>Munyana, Christella</author><author>Parsons, Ainslie B.</author><author>Ryan, Owen</author><author>Tonikian, Raffi</author><author>Roberts, Tania</author><author>Sdicu, Anne-Marie</author><author>Shapiro, Jesse</author><author>Sheikh, Bilal</author><author>Suter, Bernhard</author><author>Wong, Sharyl L.</author><author>Zhang, Lan V.</author><author>Zhu, Hongwei</author><author>Burd, Christopher G.</author><author>Munro, Sean</author><author>Sander, Chris</author><author>Rine, Jasper</author><author>Greenblatt, Jack</author><author>Peter, Matthias</author><author>Bretscher, Anthony</author><author>Bell, Graham</author><author>Roth, Frederick P.</author><author>Brown, Grant W.</author><author>Andrews, Brenda</author><author>Bussey, Howard</author><author>Boone, Charles</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Mapping of the Yeast Genetic Interaction Network</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>808-813</pages><volume>303</volume><number>5659</number><issue>5659</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004/02/06</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0036-8075, 1095-9203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1091317</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A genetic interaction network containing ∼1000 genes and ∼4000 interactions was mapped by crossing mutations in 132 different query genes into a set of ∼4700 viable gene yeast deletion mutants and scoring the double mutant progeny for fitness defects.

We describe here the pangenome of S. aureus based on analysis of genome sequences from 64 strains of S. aureus spanning a range of ecological niches, host types, and antibiotic resistance profiles. Based on this set, S. aureus is expected to have an open pangenome composed of 7,411 genes and a core genome composed of 1,441 genes. Metabolism was highly conserved in this core genome; however, differences were identified in amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways between the strains. Genome-scale models (GEMs) of metabolism were constructed for the 64 strains of S. aureus. These GEMs enabled a systems approach to characterizing the core metabolic and panmetabolic capabilities of the S. aureus species. All models were predicted to be auxotrophic for the vitamins niacin (vitamin B3) and thiamin (vitamin B1), whereas strain-specific auxotrophies were predicted for riboflavin (vitamin B2), guanosine, leucine, methionine, and cysteine, among others. GEMs were used to systematically analyze growth capabilities in more than 300 different growth-supporting environments. The results identified metabolic capabilities linked to pathogenic traits and virulence acquisitions. Such traits can be used to differentiate strains responsible for mild vs. severe infections and preference for hosts (e.g., animals vs. humans). Genome-scale analysis of multiple strains of a species can thus be used to identify metabolic determinants of virulence and increase our understanding of why certain strains of this deadly pathogen have spread rapidly throughout the world.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/113/26/E3801</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8YGPUENN\Bosi et al. - 2016 - Comparative genome-scale modelling of Staphylococc.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27286824</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6GPG3PGC\E3801.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-08-26 22:07:43</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chelliah, Vijayalakshmi</author><author>Juty, Nick</author><author>Ajmera, Ishan</author><author>Ali, Raza</author><author>Dumousseau, Marine</author><author>Glont, Mihai</author><author>Hucka, Michael</author><author>Jalowicki, Gaël</author><author>Keating, Sarah</author><author>Knight-Schrijver, Vincent</author><author>Lloret-Villas, Audald</author><author>Natarajan, Kedar Nath</author><author>Pettit, Jean-Baptiste</author><author>Rodriguez, Nicolas</author><author>Schubert, Michael</author><author>Wimalaratne, Sarala M.</author><author>Zhao, Yangyang</author><author>Hermjakob, Henning</author><author>Le Novère, Nicolas</author><author>Laibe, Camille</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>BioModels: ten-year anniversary</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acids Research</secondary-title><short-title>BioModels</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic Acids Research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucleic Acids Res</abbr-1></periodical><pages>D542-D548</pages><volume>43</volume><number>D1</number><issue>D1</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015/01/28</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0305-1048</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gku1181</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract.

However, efficacy of virulence-linked targets may be affected by the contribution of virulence-related genes to metabolism. We evaluate the complex interrelationships between growth and virulence-linked pathways using a genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 and an updated, expanded reconstruction of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. The PA14 reconstruction accounts for the activity of 112 virulence-linked genes and virulence factor synthesis pathways that produce 17 unique compounds. We integrate eight published genome-scale mutant screens to validate gene essentiality predictions in rich media, contextualize intra-screen discrepancies and evaluate virulence-linked gene distribution across essentiality datasets. Computational screening further elucidates interconnectivity between inhibition of virulence factor synthesis and growth. Successful validation of selected gene perturbations using PA14 transposon mutants demonstrates the utility of model-driven screening of therapeutic targets.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14631</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SVBDSSCQ\Bartell et al. - 2017 - Reconstruction of the metabolic network of iPseu.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\Y7NXXGC2\ncomms14631.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-05 00:20:09</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dongen, S.

In deze tak van wetenschap ontwerpt en onderzoekt men methoden die gegeven &#xD;bepaalde data een onderverdeling in groepen genereren, waarbij het oogmerk is een onderverdeling in groepen te vinden die natuurlijk is. Dat wil zeggen dat verschillende data-elementen in dezelfde groep idealiter veel op elkaar lijken, en dat data-elementen uit verschillende groepen idealiter veel van elkaar verschillen. Soms ontbreken zulke groepjes helemaal; dan is er weinig patroon te herkennen in de data. Het idee is dat de aanwezigheid van natuurlijke groepjes het mogelijk maakt de data te categoriseren. &#xD;Een voorbeeld is het clusteren van gegevens (over symptomen of lichaamskarakteristieken) van patienten die aan dezelfde ziekte lijden. Als er duidelijke groepjes bestaan in die gegevens, kan dit tot extra inzicht leiden in de ziekte. Clusteranalyse kan aldus gebruikt worden voor exploratief onderzoek. Verdere voorbeelden komen uit de &#xD;scheikunde, taxonomie, psychiatrie, archeologie, marktonderzoek en nog vele andere disicplines. Taxonomie, de studie van de classificatie van organismen, heeft een rijke geschiedenis beginnend bij Aristoteles en culminerend in de werken van Linnaeus. In feite &#xD;kan de clusteranalyse gezien worden als het resultaat van een steeds meer systematische en abstracte studie van de diverse methoden ontworpen in verschillende toepassingsgebieden, waarbij methode zowel wordt gescheiden van data en toepassingsgebied als van &#xD;berekeningswijze. &#xD;In de cluster analyse kunnen grofweg twee richtingen onderscheiden worden, naar gelang het type data dat geclassificeerd moet worden. De data-elementen in het voorbeeld hierboven worden beschreven door vectoren (lijstjes van scores of metingen), en het verschil &#xD;tussen twee elementen wordt bepaald door het verschil van de vectoren. Deze dissertatie betreft cluster analyse toegepast op data van het type `graaf'. Voorbeelden komen uit de patroonherkenning, het computer ondersteund ontwerpen, databases voorzien van &#xD;hyperlinks en het World Wide Web. In al deze gevallen is er sprake van `punten' die verbonden zijn of niet. Een stelsel van punten samen met hun verbindingen heet een graaf. Een goede clustering van een graaf deelt de punten op in groepjes zodanig dat er weinig verbindingen lopen tussen (punten uit) verschillende groepjes en er veel verbindingen zijn in elk groepje afzonderlijk.</abstract><work-type>Dissertation</work-type><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/848</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NURBMDFY\Dongen - 2000 - Graph clustering by flow simulation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\R3PH9LUA\848.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-05 15:11:19</access-date><misc2>Dissertation</misc2></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Xiaokang</author><author>Zorraquino, Violeta</author><author>Kim, Minseung</author><author>Tsoukalas, Athanasios</author><author>Tagkopoulos, Ilias</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting the evolution of Escherichia coli by a data-driven approach</title><secondary-title>Nature Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>3562</pages><volume>9</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-09-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2041-1723</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-018-05807-z</electronic-resource-num><abstract>How reproducible evolutionary processes are remains an important question in evolutionary biology.

Recent developments include prediction of reproducible patterns in parallel evolution experiments, forecasting the future of individual populations using data from their past, and controlled manipulation of evolutionary dynamics. Here we undertake a synthesis of central concepts for evolutionary predictions, based on examples of microbial and viral systems, cancer cell populations, and immune receptor repertoires. These systems have strikingly similar evolutionary dynamics driven by the competition of clades within a population. These dynamics are the basis for models that predict the evolution of clade frequencies, as well as broad genetic and phenotypic changes. Moreover, there are strong links between prediction and control, which are important for interventions such as vaccine or therapy design. All of these are key elements of what may become a predictive theory of evolution.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0077</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ZVAWSBB8\Lässig et al. - 2017 - Predicting evolution.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-07 18:26:29</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Her, Hsuan-Lin</author><author>Wu, Yu-Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A pan-genome-based machine learning approach for predicting antimicrobial resistance activities of the Escherichia coli strains</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)</full-title><abbr-1>Bioinformatics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>i89-i95</pages><volume>34</volume><number>13</number><issue>13</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>Jul 01, 2018</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1367-4811</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/bty276</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Motivation: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is becoming a huge problem in both developed and developing countries, and identifying strains resistant or susceptible to certain antibiotics is essential in fighting against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Whole-genome sequences have been collected for different microbial strains in order to identify crucial characteristics that allow certain strains to become resistant to antibiotics; however, a global inspection of the gene content responsible for AMR activities remains to be done.&#xD;Results: We propose a pan-genome-based approach to characterize antibiotic-resistant microbial strains and test this approach on the bacterial model organism Escherichia coli. By identifying core and accessory gene clusters and predicting AMR genes for the E. coli pan-genome, we not only showed that certain classes of genes are unevenly distributed between the core and accessory parts of the pan-genome but also demonstrated that only a portion of the identified AMR genes belong to the accessory genome. Application of machine learning algorithms to predict whether specific strains were resistant to antibiotic drugs yielded the best prediction accuracy for the set of AMR genes within the accessory part of the pan-genome, suggesting that these gene clusters were most crucial to AMR activities in E. coli. Selecting subsets of AMR genes for different antibiotic drugs based on a genetic algorithm (GA) achieved better prediction performances than the gene sets established in the literature, hinting that the gene sets selected by the GA may warrant further analysis in investigating more details about how E. coli fight against antibiotics.&#xD;Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29949970</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schaerli, Yolanda</author><author>Jiménez, Alba</author><author>Duarte, José M.</author><author>Mihajlovic, Ljiljana</author><author>Renggli, Julien</author><author>Isalan, Mark</author><author>Sharpe, James</author><author>Wagner, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Synthetic circuits reveal how mechanisms of gene regulatory networks constrain evolution</title><secondary-title>Molecular Systems Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Systems Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>e8102</pages><volume>14</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>constrained evolution</keyword><keyword>epistasis</keyword><keyword>gene regulatory networks</keyword><keyword>regulatory mechanisms</keyword><keyword>synthetic circuits</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018/09/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1744-4292, 1744-4292</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.15252/msb.20178102</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Phenotypic variation is the raw material of adaptive Darwinian evolution. The phenotypic variation found in organismal development is biased towards certain phenotypes, but the molecular mechanisms behind such biases are still poorly understood. Gene regulatory networks have been proposed as one cause of constrained phenotypic variation. However, most pertinent evidence is theoretical rather than experimental. Here, we study evolutionary biases in two synthetic gene regulatory circuits expressed in Escherichia coli that produce a gene expression stripe—a pivotal pattern in embryonic development. The two parental circuits produce the same phenotype, but create it through different regulatory mechanisms. We show that mutations cause distinct novel phenotypes in the two networks and use a combination of experimental measurements, mathematical modelling and DNA sequencing to understand why mutations bring forth only some but not other novel gene expression phenotypes. Our results reveal that the regulatory mechanisms of networks restrict the possible phenotypic variation upon mutation. Consequently, seemingly equivalent networks can indeed be distinct in how they constrain the outcome of further evolution.&#xD;Synopsis&#xD;&#xD;Analyses in synthetic circuits show that mutations result in distinct novel phenotypes in two circuits that showed the same phenotype before mutation. This constrained phenotypic variation is caused by differences in the circuits’ regulatory mechanisms.&#xD;&#xD;Two synthetic circuits expressed in E. coli that produce the same phenotype, but through different regulatory mechanisms, are used to study the molecular mechanisms underlying constrained phenotypic variation during evolution.The two networks create different spectra of novel phenotypes after mutation.A combination of experimental measurements, mathematical modeling and DNA sequencing shows that the regulatory mechanisms restrict the phenotypic variation that becomes accessible upon mutation.</abstract><remote-database-name>msb.embopress.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://msb.embopress.org/content/14/9/e8102</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\2GAV9QZ8\Schaerli et al. - 2018 - Synthetic circuits reveal how mechanisms of gene r.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\64CPZDCK\e8102.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-10 16:06:38</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Podnecky, Nicole L.</author><author>Fredheim, Elizabeth G.

We review the state of the art in bioreactor modeling and current efforts in modeling the intestinal microbiota. Mathematical modeling could benefit greatly from the deluge of data emerging from metagenomic studies, but data-driven approaches such as network inference that aim to predict microbiome dynamics without explicit mechanistic knowledge seem better suited to model these data.

However, the large search space of candidate drugs and dosage regimes makes the identification of effective combinations highly challenging. Here, we present a computational approach called INDIGO, which uses chemogenomics data to predict antibiotic combinations that interact synergistically or antagonistically in inhibiting bacterial growth. INDIGO quantifies the influence of individual chemical–genetic interactions on synergy and antagonism and significantly outperforms existing approaches based on experimental evaluation of novel predictions in Escherichia coli. Our analysis revealed a core set of genes and pathways (e.g. central metabolism) that are predictive of antibiotic interactions. By identifying the interactions that are associated with orthologous genes, we successfully estimated drug‐interaction outcomes in the bacterial pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus, using the E. coli INDIGO model. INDIGO thus enables the discovery of effective combination therapies in less‐studied pathogens by leveraging chemogenomics data in model organisms.&#xD;Synopsis&#xD;&#xD;Novel combination therapies are needed to counter antibiotic resistance and reduce treatment times. The INDIGO algorithm enables the discovery of effective antibiotic combinations in less‐studied pathogens by leveraging chemogenomics data in model organisms.&#xD;&#xD;INDIGO approach identifies antibiotic combinations that interact synergistically or antagonistically using chemogenomics.The analysis reveals a small set of genes in E. coli that are predictive of interaction outcomes and are surprisingly conserved between distant bacterial species.INDIGO can estimate the interaction outcomes in pathogens such as M. tuberculosis and S. aureus, based on the conservation of drug‐interaction‐related genes in E. coli.Novel predictions were experimentally validated in E. coli (66 combinations) and S. aureus (45 combinations).</abstract><remote-database-name>msb.embopress.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://msb.embopress.org/content/12/5/872</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\K3PW6XY9\Chandrasekaran et al. - 2016 - Chemogenomics and orthology‐based design of antibi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27222539</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8S9GAARW\872.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-18 14:34:14</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prudhomme, Marc</author><author>Attaiech, Laetitia</author><author>Sanchez, Guillaume</author><author>Martin, Bernard</author><author>Claverys, Jean-Pierre</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antibiotic Stress Induces Genetic Transformability in the Human Pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>89-92</pages><volume>313</volume><number>5783</number><issue>5783</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006/07/07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0036-8075, 1095-9203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1127912</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Natural transformation is a widespread mechanism for genetic exchange in bacteria.

In Escherichia coli, this stimulation is mediated by alternative DNA polymerases induced via the SOS response. Sublethal concentrations of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin have been shown to stimulate recombination between divergent sequences in E. coli. However, the effect of ciprofloxacin on recombination between homologous sequences and its SOS dependence have not been studied. Moreover, the possible effects of other antibiotics on homologous recombination remain untested. The aim of this work was to study the effects of sublethal concentrations of ciprofloxacin and 10 additional antibiotics, including different molecular families with different molecular targets, on the rate of homologous recombination of DNA in E. coli. The antibiotics tested were ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, gentamicin, rifampin (rifampicin), trimethoprim, fosfomycin, and colistin. Our results indicate that only ciprofloxacin consistently stimulates the intrachromosomal recombinogenic capability of homologous sequences in E. coli. The ciprofloxacin-based stimulation occurs at concentrations and times that apparently do not dramatically compromise the viability of the whole population, and it is dependent on RecA and partially dependent on SOS induction. One of the main findings of this work is that, apart from quinolone antibiotics, none of the most used antibiotics, including trimethoprim (a known inducer of the SOS response), has a clear side effect on homologous recombination in E. coli. In addition to the already described effects of some antibiotics on mutagenicity, DNA transfer, and genetic transformability in naturally competent species, the effect of increasing intrachromosomal recombination of homologous DNA sequences can be uniquely ascribed to fluoroquinolones, at least for E. coli.</abstract><remote-database-name>aac.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://aac.asm.org/content/53/8/3411</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3Y55P97W\López and Blázquez - 2009 - Effect of Subinhibitory Concentrations of Antibiot.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19487441</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ZR7HMGWE\3411.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-18 18:54:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laing, Chad</author><author>Buchanan, Cody</author><author>Taboada, Eduardo N.</author><author>Zhang, Yongxiang</author><author>Kropinski, Andrew</author><author>Villegas, Andre</author><author>Thomas, James E.</author><author>Gannon, Victor PJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pan-genome sequence analysis using Panseq: an online tool for the rapid analysis of core and accessory genomic regions</title><secondary-title>BMC Bioinformatics</secondary-title><short-title>Pan-genome sequence analysis using Panseq</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Bioinformatics</full-title><abbr-1>BMC Bioinformatics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>461</pages><volume>11</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>September 15, 2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2105</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2105-11-461</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The pan-genome of a bacterial species consists of a core and an accessory gene pool.

Typically, these resistant determinants are costly to the bacterial cell. Yet, recently, it has been found that, in Escherichia coli bacterial cells, a mutation conferring resistance to an antibiotic can be advantageous to the bacterial cell if another antibiotic-resistance mutation is already present, a phenomenon called sign epistasis. Here we study the interaction between antibiotic-resistance chromosomal mutations and conjugative (i.e., self-transmissible) plasmids and find many cases of sign epistasis (40%)—including one of reciprocal sign epistasis where the strain carrying both resistance determinants is fitter than the two strains carrying only one of the determinants. This implies that the acquisition of an additional resistance plasmid or of a resistance mutation often increases the fitness of a bacterial strain already resistant to antibiotics. We further show that there is an overall antagonistic interaction between mutations and plasmids (52%). These results further complicate expectations of resistance reversal by interdiction of antibiotic use., Bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics by spontaneous mutation of chromosomal genes or through the acquisition of horizontally mobile genetic elements, mainly conjugative plasmids. Plasmid-borne resistance is widespread among bacterial pathogens. Plasmids generally entail a cost to the host, associated with the replication and maintenance of the genetic element and with the expression of its genes. Therefore, in the absence of antibiotic, both plasmids and resistance mutations are often deleterious and confer a fitness cost to the cell. Here we studied epistatic interactions between five natural conjugative plasmids and ten chromosomal mutations conferring resistance to three types of antibiotics, making a total of 50 different combinations of chromosomal mutations and conjugative plasmids. We show that sometimes plasmids confer an advantage to bacterial strains carrying resistance mutations in their chromosome. This occurs in 32% (16 out of 50) of tested combinations. Furthermore, in 5 out of 50 plasmid-mutations combinations studied (10%), we observed an increased fitness when a plasmid-bearing bacterial cell acquires a drug-resistant mutation. These examples of sign epistasis are highly unexpected. This work explains, at least in part, how multidrug resistance evolved so rapidly.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145620/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SL7WTQ43\Silva et al. - 2011 - Pervasive Sign Epistasis between Conjugative Plasm.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145620/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-19 00:02:33</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stoebel, Daniel M.</author><author>Dorman, Charles J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Effect of Mobile Element IS10 on Experimental Regulatory Evolution in Escherichia coli</title><secondary-title>Molecular Biology and Evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular Biology and Evolution</full-title><abbr-1>Mol Biol Evol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2105-2112</pages><volume>27</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-9</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0737-4038</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/molbev/msq101</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mobile genetic elements are widespread in bacteria, where they cause several kinds of mutations. Although their effects are on the whole negative, rare beneficial mutations caused by insertion sequence elements are frequently selected in some experimental evolution systems. For example, in earlier work, we found that strains of Escherichia coli that lack the sigma factor RpoS adapt to a high-osmolarity environment by the insertion of element IS10 into the promoter of the otsBA operon, rewiring expression from RpoS dependent to RpoS independent. We wished to determine how the presence of IS10 in the genome of this strain shaped the evolutionary outcome. IS10 could influence the outcome by causing mutations that confer adaptive phenotypes that cannot be achieved by strains without the element. Alternatively, IS10 could influence evolution by increasing the rate of appearance of certain classes of beneficial mutations even if they are no better than those that could be achieved by a strain without the element. We found that populations evolved from an IS10-free strain did not upregulate otsBA. An otsBA-lacZY fusion facilitated the recovery of a number of mutations that upregulate otsB without involving IS10 and found that two caused greater fitness increases than IS10 insertion, implying that evolution could have upregulated otsBA in the IS10-free strain. Finally, we demonstrate that there is epistasis between the IS10 insertion into the otsBA promoter and the other adaptive mutations, implying that introduction of IS10 into the otsBA promoter may alter the trajectory of adaptive evolution. We conclude that IS10 exerts its effect not by creating adaptive phenotypes that could not otherwise occur but by increasing the rate of appearance of certain adaptive mutations.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922620/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\GLMC8CK5\Stoebel and Dorman - 2010 - The Effect of Mobile Element IS10 on Experimental .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922620/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-19 00:02:36</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>San Millan, Alvaro</author><author>Heilbron, Karl</author><author>MacLean, R Craig</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Positive epistasis between co-infecting plasmids promotes plasmid survival in bacterial populations</title><secondary-title>The ISME Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The ISME Journal</full-title><abbr-1>ISME J</abbr-1></periodical><pages>601-612</pages><volume>8</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1751-7362</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ismej.2013.182</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Plasmids have a key role in the horizontal transfer of genes among bacteria. Although plasmids are catalysts for bacterial evolution, it is challenging to understand how they can persist in bacterial populations over the long term because of the burden they impose on their hosts (the ‘plasmid paradox'). This paradox is especially perplexing in the case of ‘small' plasmids, which are unable to self-transfer by conjugation. Here, for the first time, we investigate how interactions between co-infecting plasmids influence plasmid persistence. Using an experimental model system based on interactions between a diverse assemblage of ‘large' plasmids and a single small plasmid, pNI105, in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we demonstrate that positive epistasis minimizes the cost associated with carrying multiple plasmids over the short term and increases the stability of the small plasmid over a longer time scale. In support of these experimental data, bioinformatic analysis showed that associations between small and large plasmids are more common than would be expected owing to chance alone across a range of families of bacteria; more generally, we find that co-infection with multiple plasmids is more common than would be expected owing to chance across a wide range of bacterial phyla. Collectively, these results suggest that positive epistasis promotes plasmid stability in bacterial populations. These findings pave the way for future mechanistic studies aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms of plasmid–plasmid interaction, and evolutionary studies aimed at understanding how the coevolution of plasmids drives the spread of plasmid-encoded traits.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3930321/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TYK6QGA6\San Millan et al. - 2014 - Positive epistasis between co-infecting plasmids p.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3930321/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-19 00:04:30</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rancati, Giulia</author><author>Moffat, Jason</author><author>Typas, Athanasios</author><author>Pavelka, Norman</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emerging and evolving concepts in gene essentiality</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>34-49</pages><volume>19</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-10-16</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-0056, 1471-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrg.2017.74</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Gene essentiality is a founding concept of genetics with important implications in both fundamental and applied research.

Using CRISPR interference, we created knockdowns of every essential gene in Bacillus subtilis and probed their phenotypes. Our high-conﬁdence essential gene network, established using chemical genomics, showed extensive interconnections among distantly related processes and identiﬁed modes of action for uncharacterized antibiotics. Importantly, mild knockdown of essential gene functions signiﬁcantly reduced stationary-phase survival without affecting maximal growth rate, suggesting that essential protein levels are set to maximize outgrowth from stationary phase. Finally, high-throughput microscopy indicated that cell morphology is relatively insensitive to mild knockdown but profoundly affected by depletion of gene function, revealing intimate connections between cell growth and shape.

Cytokines are highly regulated at the transcriptional level by combinations of transcription factors (TFs) that recruit cofactors and the transcriptional machinery. Here, we mined through three decades of studies to generate a comprehensive database, CytReg, reporting 843 and 647 interactions between TFs and cytokine genes, in human and mouse respectively. By integrating CytReg with other functional datasets, we determined general principles governing the transcriptional regulation of cytokine genes. In particular, we show a correlation between TF connectivity and immune phenotype and disease, we discuss the balance between tissue-speciﬁc and pathogen-activated TFs regulating each cytokine gene, and cooperativity and plasticity in cytokine regulation. We also illustrate the use of our database as a blueprint to predict TF–disease associations and identify potential TF–cytokine regulatory axes in autoimmune diseases. Finally, we discuss research biases in cytokine regulation studies, and use CytReg to predict novel interactions based on co-expression and motif analyses which we further validated experimentally. Overall, this resource provides a framework for the rational design of future cytokine gene regulation studies.</abstract><remote-database-name>DataCite</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/316612</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SWFF9GSX\Carrasco Pro et al. - 2018 - Global landscape of mouse and human cytokine trans.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-29 17:07:05</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Popa, Ovidiu</author><author>Landan, Giddy</author><author>Dagan, Tal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phylogenomic networks reveal limited phylogenetic range of lateral gene transfer by transduction</title><secondary-title>The ISME Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The ISME Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>543-554</pages><volume>11</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1751-7370</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ismej.2016.116</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Bacteriophages are recognized DNA vectors and transduction is considered as a common mechanism of lateral gene transfer (LGT) during microbial evolution. Anecdotal events of phage-mediated gene transfer were studied extensively, however, a coherent evolutionary viewpoint of LGT by transduction, its extent and characteristics, is still lacking. Here we report a large-scale evolutionary reconstruction of transduction events in 3982 genomes. We inferred 17 158 recent transduction events linking donors, phages and recipients into a phylogenomic transduction network view. We find that LGT by transduction is mostly restricted to closely related donors and recipients. Furthermore, a substantial number of the transduction events (9%) are best described as gene duplications that are mediated by mobile DNA vectors. We propose to distinguish this type of paralogy by the term autology. A comparison of donor and recipient genomes revealed that genome similarity is a superior predictor of species connectivity in the network in comparison to common habitat. This indicates that genetic similarity, rather than ecological opportunity, is a driver of successful transduction during microbial evolution. A striking difference in the connectivity pattern of donors and recipients shows that while lysogenic interactions are highly species-specific, the host range for lytic phage infections can be much wider, serving to connect dense clusters of closely related species. Our results thus demonstrate that DNA transfer via transduction occurs within the context of phage–host specificity, but that this tight constraint can be breached, on rare occasions, to produce long-range LGTs of profound evolutionary consequences.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2016116</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\WUTW34UE\Popa et al. - 2017 - Phylogenomic networks reveal limited phylogenetic .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\MJPZKLBT\ismej2016116.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-29 18:04:55</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tettelin, Hervé</author><author>Riley, David</author><author>Cattuto, Ciro</author><author>Medini, Duccio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative genomics: the bacterial pan-genome</title><secondary-title>Current Opinion in Microbiology</secondary-title><short-title>Comparative genomics</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current Opinion in Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Current Opinion in Microbiology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>472-477</pages><volume>11</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>October 1, 2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1369-5274</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.mib.2008.09.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Bacterial genome sequencing has become so easy and accessible that the genomes of multiple strains of more and more individual species have been and will be generated.

Drug pairs can interact synergistically or antagonistically, yielding inhibitory effects larger or smaller than expected from the drugs' individual potencies. Clinical strategies often favor synergistic interactions because they maximize the rate at which the infection is cleared from an individual, but it is unclear how such interactions affect the evolution of multi-drug resistance. We used a mathematical model of in vivo infection dynamics to determine the optimal treatment strategy for preventing the evolution of multi-drug resistance. We found that synergy has two conflicting effects: it clears the infection faster and thereby decreases the time during which resistant mutants can arise, but increases the selective advantage of these mutants over wild-type cells. When competition for resources is weak, the former effect is dominant and greater synergy more effectively prevents multi-drug resistance. However, under conditions of strong resource competition, a tradeoff emerges in which greater synergy increases the rate of infection clearance, but also increases the risk of multi-drug resistance. This tradeoff breaks down at a critical level of drug interaction, above which greater synergy has no effect on infection clearance, but still increases the risk of multi-drug resistance.

We conducted a retrospective study of a Burkholderia dolosa outbreak among people with cystic fibrosis, sequencing the genomes of 112 isolates collected from 14 individuals over 16 years. We find that 17 bacterial genes acquired non-synonymous mutations in multiple individuals, which indicates parallel adaptive evolution. Mutations in these genes illuminate the genetic basis of important pathogenic phenotypes, including antibiotic resistance and bacterial membrane composition, and implicate oxygen-dependent gene regulation as paramount in lung infections. Several genes have not been previously implicated in pathogenesis, suggesting new therapeutic targets. The identification of parallel molecular evolution suggests key selection forces acting on pathogens within humans and can help predict and prepare for their future evolutionary course.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245322/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\T6BMGAVT\Lieberman et al. - 2011 - Parallel bacterial evolution within multiple patie.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245322/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-30 02:08:28</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lopez, Philippe</author><author>Bapteste, Eric</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular phylogeny: reconstructing the forest</title><secondary-title>Comptes Rendus Biologies</secondary-title><short-title>Molecular phylogeny</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Comptes Rendus Biologies</full-title><abbr-1>Comptes Rendus Biologies</abbr-1></periodical><pages>171-182</pages><volume>332</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Evolution</keyword><keyword>Évolution</keyword><keyword>Fluidité du génome</keyword><keyword>Genome fluidity</keyword><keyword>Lateral gene transfers</keyword><keyword>Phylogénie</keyword><keyword>Transferts latéraux des gènes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>February 1, 2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1631-0691</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.crvi.2008.07.003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Phylogeny, be it morphological or molecular, has long tried to explain the extant biodiversity by the Tree of Species, which is a logical consequence of strict Darwinian evolutionary principles. Through constant improvement of both methods and data sets, some parts of this diversity have actually been demonstrated to be the result of a tree-like process. For some other parts, and especially for prokaryotes, different molecular markers have, however, produced different evolutionary trees, preventing the reconstruction of such a Tree. While technical artifacts could be blamed for these discrepancies, Lateral Gene Transfers are now largely held for responsible, and their existence requires an extension of the Darwinian framework, since genetic material is not always vertically inherited from parents to offspring. Through a variety of biological processes, sometimes large parts of DNA are exchanged between phylogenetically distant contemporary organisms, especially between those sharing the same environment. While mainly concerning prokaryotes, Lateral Gene Transfers have been also demonstrated to affect eukaryotes, and even multicellular ones, like plants or animals. Most of the time, these transfers allow important adaptations and the colonisation of new niches. The quantitative and qualitative importance of genetic transfers has thus severely challenged the very existence of a universal Tree of Species, since genetic connections, at least for microbes, seem more reticulated than tree-like. Even traditional biological concepts, like the concept of species, need to be re-evaluated in the light of recent discoveries. In short, instead of focusing on a elusive universal tree, biologists are now considering the whole forest corresponding to the multiple processes of inheritance, both vertical and horizontal. This constitutes the major challenge of evolutionary biology for the years to come. To cite this article: P. Lopez, E. Bapteste, C. R.

Grâce à l'amélioration constante à la fois des méthodes et des données, on a effectivement montré que certaines parties de cette biodiversité étaient le résultat d'un processus arborescent. Pour d'autres parties, en revanche, et spécialement les procaryotes, différents marqueurs moléculaires produisent des arbres différents et empêchent de reconstruire un arbre universel. Bien que divers artefacts méthodologiques puissent être la cause de ces incongruences, les Transferts Horizontaux de Gènes en sont maintenant reconnus responsables et leur existence nécessite l'extension du cadre darwinien, puisque le matériel génétique n'est pas nécessairement transmis de parents à descendants. Toute une gamme de processus biologiques permet l'échange de fragments d'ADN, parfois très grands, entre organismes contemporains phylogénétiquement éloignés, et particulièrement entre ceux qui partagent un même environnement. Bien que concernant surtout les procaryotes, on a montré récemment que les transferts horizontaux affectent aussi les eucaryotes, et même les multicellulaires, comme les plantes ou les animaux. La plupart du temps, ces transferts permettent d'importantes adaptations et la colonisation de nouveaux milieux. L'importance quantitative et qualitative des transferts de matériel génétique a donc très fortement remis en cause l'existence même d'un Arbre des Espèces, dans la mesure où les connections génétiques, du moins pour les microbes, semblent plus réticulées qu'arborescentes. Même les concepts traditionnels de biologie, comme la notion d'espèce, doivent être réévalués à la lumière des découvertes récentes. En somme, plutôt que de se concentrer sur un insaisissable Arbre Universel, les biologistes considèrent maintenant la forêt qui correspond aux multiples processus de transmission, à la fois verticaux et horizontaux. Cela constitue le défi majeur des prochaines années pour la biologie évolutive. Pour citer cet article : P. Lopez, E. Bapteste, C. R.

Synonymous mutations have been shown to impact gene expression, protein folding and fitness, however, direct evidence that they can be positively selected, and so contribute to adaptation, is lacking. Here we report the recovery of two beneficial synonymous single base pair changes that arose spontaneously and independently in an experimentally evolved population of Pseudomonas fluorescens. We show experimentally that these mutations increase fitness by an amount comparable to non-synonymous mutations and that the fitness increases stem from increased gene expression. These results provide unequivocal evidence that synonymous mutations can drive adaptive evolution and suggest that this class of mutation may be underappreciated as a cause of adaptation and evolutionary dynamics.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5076</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\AEUEPBR7\Bailey et al. - 2014 - Adaptive synonymous mutations in an experimentally.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PBYKW2YR\ncomms5076.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-30 04:48:57</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lang, Gregory I.</author><author>Rice, Daniel P.</author><author>Hickman, Mark J.</author><author>Sodergren, Erica</author><author>Weinstock, George M.</author><author>Botstein, David</author><author>Desai, Michael M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pervasive genetic hitchhiking and clonal interference in forty evolving yeast populations</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>571-574</pages><volume>500</volume><number>7464</number><issue>7464</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1476-4687</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature12344</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The dynamics of adaptation determine which mutations fix in a population, and hence how reproducible evolution will be.

In laboratory evolution experiments, demonstrably beneficial mutations are found repeatedly6,7,8, but are often accompanied by other mutations with no obvious benefit. Here we use whole-genome whole-population sequencing to examine the dynamics of genome sequence evolution at high temporal resolution in 40 replicate Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations growing in rich medium for 1,000 generations. We find pervasive genetic hitchhiking: multiple mutations arise and move synchronously through the population as mutational ‘cohorts’. Multiple clonal cohorts are often present simultaneously, competing with each other in the same population. Our results show that patterns of sequence evolution are driven by a balance between these chance effects of hitchhiking and interference, which increase stochastic variation in evolutionary outcomes, and the deterministic action of selection on individual mutations, which favours parallel evolutionary solutions in replicate populations.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12344</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\MIN8FQW3\Lang et al. - 2013 - Pervasive genetic hitchhiking and clonal interfere.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\632IIMQ4\nature12344.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-30 04:53:18</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Popa, Ovidiu</author><author>Landan, Giddy</author><author>Dagan, Tal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phylogenomic networks reveal limited phylogenetic range of lateral gene transfer by transduction</title><secondary-title>The ISME Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The ISME Journal</full-title><abbr-1>ISME J</abbr-1></periodical><pages>543-554</pages><volume>11</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1751-7362</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ismej.2016.116</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Bacteriophages are recognized DNA vectors and transduction is considered as a common mechanism of lateral gene transfer (LGT) during microbial evolution. Anecdotal events of phage-mediated gene transfer were studied extensively, however, a coherent evolutionary viewpoint of LGT by transduction, its extent and characteristics, is still lacking. Here we report a large-scale evolutionary reconstruction of transduction events in 3982 genomes. We inferred 17 158 recent transduction events linking donors, phages and recipients into a phylogenomic transduction network view. We find that LGT by transduction is mostly restricted to closely related donors and recipients. Furthermore, a substantial number of the transduction events (9%) are best described as gene duplications that are mediated by mobile DNA vectors. We propose to distinguish this type of paralogy by the term autology. A comparison of donor and recipient genomes revealed that genome similarity is a superior predictor of species connectivity in the network in comparison to common habitat. This indicates that genetic similarity, rather than ecological opportunity, is a driver of successful transduction during microbial evolution. A striking difference in the connectivity pattern of donors and recipients shows that while lysogenic interactions are highly species-specific, the host range for lytic phage infections can be much wider, serving to connect dense clusters of closely related species. Our results thus demonstrate that DNA transfer via transduction occurs within the context of phage–host specificity, but that this tight constraint can be breached, on rare occasions, to produce long-range LGTs of profound evolutionary consequences.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5183456/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\GC5A5NGH\Popa et al. - 2017 - Phylogenomic networks reveal limited phylogenetic .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5183456/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-09-30 20:09:19</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oliveira, Pedro H.</author><author>Touchon, Marie</author><author>Cury, Jean</author><author>Rocha, Eduardo P.

We perform an exhaustive computational screening of synthetic lethal reaction pairs in Escherichia coli in a minimal medium and we find that synthetic lethal pairs divide in two different groups depending on whether the synthetic lethal interaction works as a backup or as a parallel use mechanism, the first corresponding to essential plasticity and the second to essential redundancy. In E. coli, the analysis of pathways entanglement through essential redundancy supports the view that synthetic lethality affects preferentially a single function or pathway. In contrast, essential plasticity, the dominant class, tends to be inter-pathway but strongly localized and unveils Cell Envelope Biosynthesis as an essential backup for Membrane Lipid Metabolism. When comparing E. coli and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, we find that the metabolic networks of the two organisms exhibit a large difference in the relative importance of plasticity and redundancy which is consistent with the conjecture that plasticity is a sophisticated mechanism that requires a complex organization. Finally, coessential reaction pairs are explored in different environmental conditions to uncover the interplay between the two mechanisms. We find that synthetic lethal interactions and their classification in plasticity and redundancy are basically insensitive to medium composition, and are highly conserved even when the environment is enriched with nonessential compounds or overconstrained to decrease maximum biomass formation., Plasticity and redundancy are essential features of biological systems, from brain to genome, that underlie the ability of organisms to survive. In metabolic networks, these essential mechanisms are unveiled by the analysis and categorization of synthetic lethal pairs of reactions. We find that plasticity acts as a backup mechanism that reorganizes metabolic fluxes, while redundancy corresponds to a simultaneous use of different flux channels that increases fitness. Both capacities ensure viability and are highly insensitive to environmental conditions, but plasticity seems a more sophisticated mechanism requiring a more complex functional organization. Our results have clear implications for biotechnology and biomedicine, since targeting a plasticity or a redundancy synthetic lethal pair will certainly have different requirements and peculiar specific effects.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4031049/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\MHXZIA6I\Güell et al. - 2014 - Essential Plasticity and Redundancy of Metabolism .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4031049/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-10-08 20:45:57</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Deutscher, David</author><author>Meilijson, Isaac</author><author>Kupiec, Martin</author><author>Ruppin, Eytan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multiple knockout analysis of genetic robustness in the yeast metabolic network</title><secondary-title>Nature Genetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Genetics</full-title></periodical><pages>993-998</pages><volume>38</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1546-1718</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ng1856</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Genetic robustness characterizes the constancy of the phenotype in face of heritable perturbations.

These plasmid‐mediated mechanisms of resistance confer low levels of resistance but provide a favourable background in which selection of additional chromosomally encoded quinolone resistance mechanisms can occur.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3815421/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\YAL8D29Z\Fàbrega et al. - 2009 - Mechanism of action of and resistance to quinolone.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3815421/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-10-08 20:53:26</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Page, Andrew J.</author><author>Cummins, Carla A.</author><author>Hunt, Martin</author><author>Wong, Vanessa K.</author><author>Reuter, Sandra</author><author>Holden, Matthew T.

Sequencing 240 isolates of the PMEN1 (Spain23F-1) multidrug-resistant lineage enabled base substitutions to be distinguished from polymorphisms arising through horizontal sequence transfer. More than 700 recombinations were detected, with genes encoding major antigens frequently affected. Among these were 10 capsule-switching events, one of which accompanied a population shift as vaccine-escape serotype 19A isolates emerged in the USA after the introduction of the conjugate polysaccharide vaccine. The evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolones, rifampicin, and macrolides was observed to occur on multiple occasions.

Such processes can be characterized as “uphill walks on rugged fitness landscapes”. Concrete examples of fitness landscapes include the distribution of any specific functional property such as the capacity to catalyze a specific reaction, or bind a specific ligand, in “protein space”. In particular, the property might be the affinity of all possible antibody molecules for a specific antigenic determinant. That affinity landscape presumably plays a critical role in maturation of the immune response. In this process, hypermutation and clonal selection act to select antibody V region mutant variants with successively higher affinity for the immunizing antigen. The actual statistical structure of affinity landscapes, although knowable, is currently unknown. Here, we analyze a class of mathematical models we call NK models. We show that these models capture significant features of the maturation of the immune response, which is currently thought to share features with general protein evolution. The NK models have the important property that, as the parameter K increases, the “ruggedness” of the NK landscape varies from a single peaked “Fujiyama” landscape to a multi-peaked “badlands” landscape. Walks to local optima on such landscapes become shorter as K increases. This fact allows us to choose a value of K that corresponds to the experimentally observed number of mutational “steps”, 6–8, taken as an antibody sequence matures. If the mature antibody is taken to correspond to a local optimum in the model, tuning the model requires that K be about 40, implying that the functional contribution of each amino acid in the V region is affected by about 40 others. Given this value of K, the model then predicts several features of “antibody space” that are in qualitative agreement with experiment: (1) The fraction of fitter variants of an initial “roughed in” germ line antibody amplified by clonal selection is about 1–2%. (2) Mutations at some sites of the mature antibody hardly affect antibody function at all, but mutations at other sites dramatically decrease function. (3) The same “roughed in” antibody sequence can “walk” to many mature antibody sequences. (4) Many adaptive walks can end on the same local optimum. (5) Comparison of different mature sequences derived from the same initial V region shows evolutionary hot spots and parallel mutations. All these predictions are open to detailed testing by obtaining monoclonal antibodies early in the immune response and carrying out in vitro mutagenesis and adaptive hill climbing with respect to affinity for the immunizing antigen.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519389800190</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\959WL4HK\S0022519389800190.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-10-08 21:16:21</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Henry, Christopher S.</author><author>DeJongh, Matthew</author><author>Best, Aaron A.</author><author>Frybarger, Paul M.</author><author>Linsay, Ben</author><author>Stevens, Rick L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High-throughput generation, optimization and analysis of genome-scale metabolic models</title><secondary-title>Nature Biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Biotechnology</full-title></periodical><pages>977-982</pages><volume>28</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1546-1696</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nbt.1672</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Genome-scale metabolic models have proven to be valuable for predicting organism phenotypes from genotypes.

The Model SEED integrates existing methods and introduces techniques to automate nearly every step of this process, taking ∼48 h to reconstruct a metabolic model from an assembled genome sequence. We apply this resource to generate 130 genome-scale metabolic models representing a taxonomically diverse set of bacteria. Twenty-two of the models were validated against available gene essentiality and Biolog data, with the average model accuracy determined to be 66% before optimization and 87% after optimization.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.1672</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ZFPIWR9N\Henry et al. - 2010 - High-throughput generation, optimization and analy.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\9TGYBGDK\nbt.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-10-08 21:18:23</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Typas, Athanasios</author><author>Nichols, Robert J.</author><author>Siegele, Deborah A.</author><author>Shales, Michael</author><author>Collins, Sean R.</author><author>Lim, Bentley</author><author>Braberg, Hannes</author><author>Yamamoto, Natsuko</author><author>Takeuchi, Rikiya</author><author>Wanner, Barry L.</author><author>Mori, Hirotada</author><author>Weissman, Jonathan S.</author><author>Krogan, Nevan J.</author><author>Gross, Carol A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title><style face="normal">High-throughput, quantitative analyses of genetic interactions in </style><style face="italic">E. coli</style></title><secondary-title>Nature Methods</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Methods</full-title></periodical><pages>781-787</pages><volume>5</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1548-7105</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nmeth.1240</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Large-scale genetic interaction studies provide the basis for defining gene function and pathway architecture. Recent advances in the ability to generate double mutants en masse in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have dramatically accelerated the acquisition of genetic interaction information and the biological inferences that follow. Here we describe a method based on F factor–driven conjugation, which allows for high-throughput generation of double mutants in Escherichia coli. This method, termed genetic interaction analysis technology for E. coli (GIANT-coli), permits us to systematically generate and array double-mutant cells on solid media in high-density arrays. We show that colony size provides a robust and quantitative output of cellular fitness and that GIANT-coli can recapitulate known synthetic interactions and identify previously unidentified negative (synthetic sickness or lethality) and positive (suppressive or epistatic) relationships. Finally, we describe a complementary strategy for genome-wide suppressor-mutant identification.

Predictions on bacterial survival and adaptive outcomes could thus have great prognostic value. However, it is unknown what information is required to enable such predictions. By developing a novel network-based analysis method, a bacterium's phenotypic and transcriptional response can be objectively quantified in temporal 3D-feature space. The resulting trajectories can be interpreted as a degree of coordination, where a focused and coordinated response predicts bacterial survival-success, and a random uncoordinated response predicts survival-failure. These predictions extend to both antibiotic resistance and in vivo infection conditions and are applicable to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, through experimental evolution we show that the degree of coordination is an adaptive outcome - an uncoordinated response evolves into a coordinated response when a bacterium adapts to its environment. Most surprisingly, it turns out that phenotypic and transcriptional response data, network features and genome plasticity data can be used to train a machine learning model that is able to predict which genes in the genome will adapt under nutrient or antibiotic selection. Importantly, this suggests that deterministic factors help drive adaptation and that evolution is, at least partially, predictable. This work demonstrates that with the right information predictions on bacterial short-term survival and long-term adaptive outcomes are feasible, which underscores that personalized infectious disease diagnostics and treatments are possible, and should be developed.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.biorxiv.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/09/387910</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\IY9YLJMW\Zhu et al. - 2018 - Forecasting bacterial survival-success and adaptiv.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\CW5YZ52P\387910.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-10-14 20:18:05</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jeong, H.</author><author>Mason, S.

However, technical artifacts can confound signal across genetic screens and limit the immense potential of parallel screening approaches. To address this problem, we devised a novel PCA‐based method for correcting genome‐wide screening data, bolstering the sensitivity and specificity of detection for genetic interactions. Applying this strategy to a set of 436 whole genome CRISPR screens, we report more than 1.5 million pairs of correlated “co‐functional” genes that provide finer‐scale information about cell compartments, biological pathways, and protein complexes than traditional gene sets. Lastly, we employed a gene community detection approach to implicate core genes for cancer growth and compress signal from functionally related genes in the same community into a single score. This work establishes new algorithms for probing cancer cell networks and motivates the acquisition of further CRISPR screen data across diverse genotypes and cell types to further resolve complex cellular processes.&#xD;Synopsis&#xD;&#xD;Learning signatures of confounding in pooled gene knockout screens increases power to detect co‐essential gene pairs by an order of magnitude. Analysis of hundreds of deconfounded cancer cell line growth screens generates new hypotheses for cancer drug targets and tissue‐specific growth pathways.&#xD;&#xD;Over 1.5 million pairs of correlated gene essentiality profiles are identified.Co‐essential gene pairs are shown to be co‐functional interactions broadly enriched for known biological pathways.One‐dimensional genetic screens performed in parallel suffice to build genome‐wide co‐functional networks that exhibit diffusion of signal through gene‐gene edges.Hijacking of gene modules by cancer driver genes is implicated as the modus operandi for several well‐studied malignancies.</abstract><remote-database-name>msb.embopress.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://msb.embopress.org/content/14/12/e8594</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\664NIVW9\Boyle et al. - 2018 - High‐resolution mapping of cancer cell networks us.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573688</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\KGUGE7HW\e8594.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-12-26 17:27:12</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Engholm, Ditte Høyer</author><author>Kilian, Mogens</author><author>Goodsell, David S.</author><author>Andersen, Ebbe Sloth</author><author>Kjærgaard, Rikke Schmidt</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A visual review of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae</title><secondary-title>FEMS Microbiology Reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FEMS Microbiology Reviews</full-title><abbr-1>FEMS Microbiol Rev</abbr-1></periodical><pages>854-879</pages><volume>41</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017/11/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0168-6445</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/femsre/fux037</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This article provides a visual overview of central molecular processes in Streptococcus pneumoniae through a series of eight watercolor paintings that are based</abstract><remote-database-name>academic.oup.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/41/6/854/4345647</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TLH2BKDV\Engholm et al. - 2017 - A visual review of the human pathogen Streptococcu.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\CKHP6HLF\4345647.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2018-12-30 22:37:45</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jeffrey, H J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chaos game representation of gene structure.</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acids Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic Acids Research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucleic Acids Res</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2163-2170</pages><volume>18</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990-4-25</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0305-1048</isbn><abstract>This paper presents a new method for representing DNA sequences.

Furthermore, most approaches do not take gene synteny into account, which is useful information for disentangling paralogues. Here, we present SynerClust, a user-friendly synteny-aware tool based on synergy that can process thousands of genomes. SynerClust was designed to analyse genomes with high levels of local synteny, particularly prokaryotes, which have operon structure. SynerClust’s run-time is optimized by selecting cluster representatives at each node in the phylogeny; thus, avoiding the need for exhaustive pairwise similarity searches. In benchmarking against Roary, Hieranoid2, PanX and Reciprocal Best Hit, SynerClust was able to more completely identify sets of core genes for datasets that included diverse strains, while using substantially less memory, and with scalability comparable to the fastest tools. Due to its scalability, ease of installation and use, and suitability for a variety of computing environments, orthogroup clustering using SynerClust will enable many large-scale prokaryotic comparative genomics efforts.</abstract><remote-database-name>Microbiology Society Journals</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://mgen.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000231</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\UR5Z9EU7\Georgescu et al. - 2018 - SynerClust a highly scalable, synteny-aware ortho.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\IYZ474UK\mgen.0.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-01-04 15:59:45</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hiller, N.

It is a common colonizer of the human host, and in the nasopharynx, sinus, and middle ear it survives as a biofilm. This mode of growth is optimal for multi-strain colonization and genetic exchange. Over the last decades, the far-reaching use of antibiotics and the widespread implementation of pneumococcal multivalent conjugate vaccines have posed considerable selective pressure on pneumococci. This scenario provides an exceptional opportunity to study the evolution of the pangenome of a clinically important bacterium, and has the potential to serve as a case study for other species. The goals of this review are to discuss pneumococcal genomic diversity and plasticity, and highlight general principles and exciting open questions in the context of bacterial biology and evolution.</abstract><remote-database-name>Frontiers</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02580/full</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ME36IVRF\Hiller and Sá-Leão - 2018 - Puzzling Over the Pneumococcal Pangenome.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2019-01-04 16:02:28</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tonder, Andries J. van</author><author>Bray, James E.</author><author>Jolley, Keith A.</author><author>Quirk, Sigridur J.</author><author>Haraldsson, Gunnsteinn</author><author>Maiden, Martin C.

Estimating the core genome, the genes common to all or nearly all strains of a species, is an essential component of such analyses. The size and composition of the core genome varies by dataset, but our hypothesis was that variation between different collections of the same bacterial species should be minimal. To test this, the genome sequences of 3,121 pneumococci recovered from healthy individuals in Reykjavik (Iceland), Southampton (United Kingdom), Boston (USA) and Maela (Thailand) were analysed. Results: The analyses revealed a supercore genome (genes shared by all 3,121 pneumococci) of only 303 genes, although 461 additional core genes were shared by pneumococci from Reykjavik, Southampton and Boston. Overall, the size and composition of the core genomes and pan-genomes among pneumococci recovered in Reykjavik, Southampton and Boston were very similar, but pneumococci from Maela were distinctly different. Inspection of the pan-genome of Maela pneumococci revealed several &gt;25 Kb sequence regions that were homologous to genomic regions found in other bacterial species. Conclusions: Some subsets of the global pneumococcal population are highly heterogeneous and thus our hypothesis was rejected. This is an essential point of consideration before generalising the findings from a single dataset to the wider pneumococcal population.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.biorxiv.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/06/133991</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\V3VFJR2B\Tonder et al. - 2017 - Heterogeneity Among Estimates Of The Core Genome A.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PZHQGU2S\133991.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-01-04 16:05:11</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barczak, Amy K.</author><author>Gomez, James E.</author><author>Kaufmann, Benjamin B.</author><author>Hinson, Ella R.</author><author>Cosimi, Lisa</author><author>Borowsky, Mark L.</author><author>Onderdonk, Andrew B.</author><author>Stanley, Sarah A.</author><author>Kaur, Devinder</author><author>Bryant, Kevin F.</author><author>Knipe, David M.</author><author>Sloutsky, Alexander</author><author>Hung, Deborah T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RNA signatures allow rapid identification of pathogens and antibiotic susceptibilities</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</full-title><abbr-1>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</abbr-1></periodical><pages>6217-6222</pages><volume>109</volume><number>16</number><issue>16</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-4-17</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1119540109</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With rising rates of drug-resistant infections, there is a need for diagnostic methods that rapidly can detect the presence of pathogens and reveal their susceptibility to antibiotics. Here we propose an approach to diagnosing the presence and drug-susceptibility of infectious diseases based on direct detection of RNA from clinical samples. We demonstrate that species-specific RNA signatures can be used to identify a broad spectrum of infectious agents, including bacteria, viruses, yeast, and parasites. Moreover, we show that the behavior of a small set of bacterial transcripts after a brief antibiotic pulse can rapidly differentiate drug-susceptible and -resistant organisms and that these measurements can be made directly from clinical materials. Thus, transcriptional signatures could form the basis of a uniform diagnostic platform applicable across a broad range of infectious agents.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341018/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\7MSFB2W7\Barczak et al. - 2012 - RNA signatures allow rapid identification of patho.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341018/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-01-09 17:09:48</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goswami, Manish</author><author>Rao, Akkipeddi Venkat Satya Surya Narayana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transcriptome Profiling Reveals Interplay of Multifaceted Stress Response in Escherichia coli on Exposure to Glutathione and Ciprofloxacin</title><secondary-title>mSystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>mSystems</full-title></periodical><pages>e00001-18</pages><volume>3</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018/02/27</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2379-5077</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/mSystems.00001-18</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We have previously reported that supplementation of exogenous glutathione (GSH) promotes ciprofloxacin resistance in Escherichia coli by neutralizing antibiotic-induced oxidative stress and by enhancing the efflux of antibiotic. In the present study, we used a whole-genome microarray as a tool to analyze the system-level transcriptomic changes of E. coli on exposure to GSH and/or ciprofloxacin. The microarray data revealed that GSH supplementation affects redox function, transport, acid shock, and virulence genes of E. coli. The data further highlighted the interplay of multiple underlying stress response pathways (including those associated with the genes mentioned above and DNA damage repair genes) at the core of GSH, offsetting the effect of ciprofloxacin in E. coli. The results of a large-scale validation of the transcriptomic data using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis for 40 different genes were mostly in agreement with the microarray results. The altered growth profiles of 12 different E. coli strains carrying deletions in the specific genes mentioned above with GSH and/or ciprofloxacin supplementation implicate these genes in the GSH-mediated phenotype not only at the molecular level but also at the functional level. We further associated GSH supplementation with increased acid shock survival of E. coli on the basis of our transcriptomic data. Taking the data together, it can be concluded that GSH supplementation influences the expression of genes of multiple stress response pathways apart from its effect(s) at the physiological level to counter the action of ciprofloxacin in E. coli.&#xD;IMPORTANCE The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains have serious medical and clinical consequences. In addition, the rate of discovery of new therapeutic antibiotics has been inadequate in last few decades. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin represent a precious therapeutic resource in the fight against bacterial pathogens. However, these antibiotics have been gradually losing their appeal due to the emergence and buildup of resistance to them. In this report, we shed light on the genome-level expression changes in bacteria with respect to glutathione (GSH) exposure which act as a trigger for fluoroquinolone antibiotic resistance. The knowledge about different bacterial stress response pathways under conditions of exposure to the conditions described above and potential points of cross talk between them could help us in understanding and formulating the conditions under which buildup and spread of antibiotic resistance could be minimized. Our findings are also relevant because GSH-induced genome-level expression changes have not been reported previously for E. coli.</abstract><remote-database-name>msystems.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://msystems.asm.org/content/3/1/e00001-18</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\KPMQAHHF\Goswami and Rao - 2018 - Transcriptome Profiling Reveals Interplay of Multi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29468195</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\E383P2CL\e00001-18.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-01-09 17:09:54</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bhattacharyya, Roby</author><author>Liu, Jamin</author><author>Ma, Peijun</author><author>Bandyopadhyay, Nirmalya</author><author>Livny, Jonathan</author><author>Hung, Deborah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rapid Phenotypic Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing Through RNA Detection</title><secondary-title>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</full-title><abbr-1>Open Forum Infect Dis</abbr-1></periodical><pages>S33-S33</pages><volume>4</volume><number>suppl_1</number><issue>suppl_1</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017/10/01</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/ofid/ofx162.082</electronic-resource-num><abstract>AbstractBackground.

Traditional culture-based methods for antibiotic susceptibility testing are unacceptably slow (1–2 days), resulting in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the further development and spread of resistance. Critically needed is a rapid antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) that can guide treatment at the point-of-care. Rapid phenotypic approaches using quantification of DNA have been demonstrated for fast-growing organisms (e.g. E. coli) but are challenging for slower-growing pathogens such as N. gonorrhoeae. Here, we investigate the potential of RNA signatures to provide phenotypic responses to antibiotics in N. gonorrhoeae that are faster and greater in magnitude compared with DNA. Using RNA sequencing, we identified antibiotic-responsive transcripts. Significant shifts (&gt;4-fold change) in transcript levels occurred within 5 min of antibiotic exposure. We designed assays for responsive transcripts with the highest abundances and fold changes, and validated gene expression using digital PCR. Using the top two markers (porB and rpmB) we correctly determined the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of 49 clinical isolates after 10 min exposure to ciprofloxacin. RNA signatures are therefore promising as an approach on which to build rapid AST devices for N. gonorrhoeae at the point-of-care, which is critical for disease management, surveillance, and antibiotic stewardship efforts.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6072703/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SHJ9PX82\Khazaei et al. - 2018 - RNA markers enable phenotypic test of antibiotic s.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6072703/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-01-09 17:10:07</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dietterich, Thomas G.</author></authors><tertiary-authors><author>Goos, Gerhard</author><author>Hartmanis, Juris</author><author>van Leeuwen, Jan</author></tertiary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning</title><secondary-title>Multiple Classifier Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Multiple Classifier Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>1857</volume><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Berlin, Heidelberg</pub-location><publisher>Springer Berlin Heidelberg</publisher><isbn>978-3-540-67704-8 978-3-540-45014-6</isbn><abstract>Ensemble methods are learning algorithms that construct a set of classi ers and then classify new data points by taking a (weighted) vote of their predictions.

Some previous studies comparing ensemble methods are reviewed, and some new experiments are presented to uncover the reasons that Adaboost does not over t rapidly.</abstract><remote-database-name>Crossref</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/3-540-45014-9_1</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\DQVTKSIW\Dietterich - 2000 - Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2019-01-16 22:00:26</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pedregosa, Fabian</author><author>Varoquaux, Gael</author><author>Gramfort, Alexandre</author><author>Michel, Vincent</author><author>Thirion, Bertrand</author><author>Grisel, Olivier</author><author>Blondel, Mathieu</author><author>Prettenhofer, Peter</author><author>Weiss, Ron</author><author>Dubourg, Vincent</author><author>Vanderplas, Jake</author><author>Passos, Alexandre</author><author>Cournapeau, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python</title><secondary-title>MACHINE LEARNING IN PYTHON</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MACHINE LEARNING IN PYTHON</full-title></periodical><pages>6</pages><dates/><abstract>Scikit-learn is a Python module integrating a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for medium-scale supervised and unsupervised problems.

Here we describe a general method for the detection of a protein domain of interest in any species for which a complete proteome exists. In particular, we apply this approach to identify histidine phosphotransfer (HPt) domain-containing proteins across a range of eukaryotic species. From the sequences of known HPt domains, we created an amino acid occurrence matrix which we then used to define a conserved, probabilistic motif. Examination of various organisms either known to contain (plant and fungal species) or believed to lack (mammals) HPt domains established criteria by which new HPt candidates were identified and ranked. Search results using a probabilistic motif matrix compare favorably with data to be found in several commonly used protein structure/function databases: our method identified all known HPt proteins in the Arabidopsis thaliana proteome, confirmed the absence of such motifs in mice and humans, and suggests new candidate HPts in several organisms. Moreover, probabilistic motif searching can be applied more generally, in a manner both readily customized and computationally compact, to other protein domains; this utility is demonstrated by our identification of histones in a range of eukaryotic organisms.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146577</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\I67Y9TMR\Surujon and Ratner - 2016 - Use of a Probabilistic Motif Search to Identify Hi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\JY82YZMU\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-05 02:22:11</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Dechao</author><author>Gu, Quanquan</author><author>Ma, Jian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying gene regulatory network rewiring using latent differential graphical models</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acids Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic Acids Research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucleic Acids Res</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e140-e140</pages><volume>44</volume><number>17</number><issue>17</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016/09/30</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0305-1048</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkw581</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract.

Over the last fifteen years this problem has been of significant interest in the statistics, machine learning, and statistical physics communities, and much of the effort has been directed towards finding algorithms with low computational cost for various restricted classes of models. Nevertheless, for learning Ising models on general graphs with p nodes of degree at most d, it is not known whether or not it is possible to improve upon the pd computation needed to exhaustively search over all possible neighborhoods for each node. In this paper we show that a simple greedy procedure allows to learn the structure of an Ising model on an arbitrary bounded-degree graph in time on the order of p2. We make no assumptions on the parameters except what is necessary for identifiability of the model, and in particular the results hold at low-temperatures as well as for highly non-uniform models. The proof rests on a new structural property of Ising models: we show that for any node there exists at least one neighbor with which it has a high mutual information.</abstract><remote-database-name>ACM Digital Library</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2746539.2746631</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\XE9H49MI\Bresler - 2015 - Efficiently Learning Ising Models on Arbitrary Gra.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-08 02:18:53</access-date><custom1>New York, NY, USA</custom1><custom3>Proceedings of the Forty-seventh Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shin, Junha</author><author>Lee, Tak</author><author>Kim, Hanhae</author><author>Lee, Insuk</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Complementarity between distance- and probability-based methods of gene neighbourhood identification for pathway reconstruction</title><secondary-title>Molecular BioSystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Molecular BioSystems</full-title></periodical><pages>24-29</pages><volume>10</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/C3MB70366E</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>pubs.rsc.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/mb/c3mb70366e</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\S3A4S9SP\Shin et al. - 2014 - Complementarity between distance- and probability-.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\4R9DMQ5I\c3mb70366e.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-08 02:43:09</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qi, Yanjun</author><author>Bar-Joseph, Ziv</author><author>Klein-Seetharaman, Judith</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of Different Biological Data and Computational Classification Methods for Use in Protein Interaction Prediction</title><secondary-title>Proteins</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proteins</full-title><abbr-1>Proteins</abbr-1></periodical><pages>490-500</pages><volume>63</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006-5-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0887-3585</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/prot.20865</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Protein–protein interactions play a key role in many biological systems. High-throughput methods can directly detect the set of interacting proteins in yeast, but the results are often incomplete and exhibit high false-positive and false-negative rates. Recently, many different research groups independently suggested using supervised learning methods to integrate direct and indirect biological data sources for the protein interaction prediction task. However, the data sources, approaches, and implementations varied. Furthermore, the protein interaction prediction task itself can be subdivided into prediction of (1) physical interaction, (2) co-complex relationship, and (3) pathway co-membership. To investigate systematically the utility of different data sources and the way the data is encoded as features for predicting each of these types of protein interactions, we assembled a large set of biological features and varied their encoding for use in each of the three prediction tasks. Six different classifiers were used to assess the accuracy in predicting interactions, Random Forest (RF), RF similarity-based k-Nearest-Neighbor, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. For all classifiers, the three prediction tasks had different success rates, and co-complex prediction appears to be an easier task than the other two. Independently of prediction task, however, the RF classifier consistently ranked as one of the top two classifiers for all combinations of feature sets. Therefore, we used this classifier to study the importance of different biological datasets. First, we used the splitting function of the RF tree structure, the Gini index, to estimate feature importance. Second, we determined classification accuracy when only the top-ranking features were used as an input in the classifier. We find that the importance of different features depends on the specific prediction task and the way they are encoded. Strikingly, gene expression is consistently the most important feature for all three prediction tasks, while the protein interactions identified using the yeast-2-hybrid system were not among the top-ranking features under any condition.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250929/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TFBDVHTV\Qi et al. - 2006 - Evaluation of Different Biological Data and Comput.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250929/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-08 14:58:15</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, L.</author><author>Liao, L.</author><author>Wu, C.

However, how to quickly learn weights for heterogeneous data sources remains a challenge. In this work, we developed a method to infer de novo PPIs by combining multiple data sources represented in kernel format and obtaining optimal weights based on random walk over the existing partial network. Our proposed method utilizes Baker algorithm and the training data to construct a transition matrix which constrains how a random walk would traverse the partial network. Multiple heterogeneous features for the proteins in the network, including gene expression and Pfam domain profiles, are then combined into the form of a weighted kernel, which provides a new “adjacency matrix” for the whole network but is required to comply with the transition matrix on the part of the training subnetwork. This requirement is met by adjusting the weights to minimize the element-wise difference between the transition matrix and the weighted kernel. The minimization problem is solved by linear programming. The weighted kernel is then transformed to regularized Laplacian (RL) kernel to infer missing or new edges in the PPI network. The results on synthetic data and real data from Yeast show that the accuracy of PPI prediction measured by AUC is increased by up to 19% as compared to a control method without using optimal weights. Moreover, the weights learned by our method Weight Optimization by Linear Programming (WOLP) are very consistent with that learned by sampling, and can provide insights into the relations between PPIs and various feature kernels, thereby improving PPI prediction.</abstract><remote-database-name>IEEE Xplore</remote-database-name><urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PSFPGZHW\Huang et al. - 2015 - Protein-protein interaction network inference from.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TJBRBAUL\7359681.html</url></text-urls></urls><custom3>2015 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horvath, S.</author><author>Zhang, B.</author><author>Carlson, M.</author><author>Lu, K.

Patients with this disease have a median survival of 15 months from the time of diagnosis despite surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. New treatment approaches are needed. Recent works suggest that glioblastoma patients may benefit from molecularly targeted therapies. Here, we address the compelling need for identification of new molecular targets. Leveraging global gene expression data from two independent sets of clinical tumor samples (n = 55 and n = 65), we identify a gene coexpression module in glioblastoma that is also present in breast cancer and significantly overlaps with the “metasignature” for undifferentiated cancer. Studies in an isogenic model system demonstrate that this module is downstream of the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFRvIII, and that it can be inhibited by the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Erlotinib. We identify ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated) as a key gene within this module and demonstrate its overexpression in glioblastoma relative to normal brain (or body tissues). Finally, we show that ASPM inhibition by siRNA-mediated knockdown inhibits tumor cell proliferation and neural stem cell proliferation, supporting ASPM as a potential molecular target in glioblastoma. Our weighted gene coexpression network analysis provides a blueprint for leveraging genomic data to identify key control networks and molecular targets for glioblastoma, and the principle eluted from our work can be applied to other cancers.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.pnas.org/content/103/46/17402</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\JTT2HINA\Horvath et al. - 2006 - Analysis of oncogenic signaling networks in gliobl.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17090670</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\4ZARZP96\17402.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-12 23:59:28</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Du, Xiangjun</author><author>Wang, Zhuo</author><author>Wu, Aiping</author><author>Song, Lin</author><author>Cao, Yang</author><author>Hang, Haiying</author><author>Jiang, Taijiao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Networks of genomic co-occurrence capture characteristics of human influenza A (H3N2) evolution</title><secondary-title>Genome Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Research</full-title><abbr-1>Genome Res.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>178-187</pages><volume>18</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>01/01/2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1088-9051, 1549-5469</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.6969007</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The recent availability of full genomic sequence data for a large number of human influenza A (H3N2) virus isolates over many years provides us an opportunity to analyze human influenza virus evolution by considering all gene segments simultaneously. However, such analysis requires development of new computational models that can capture the complex evolutionary features over the entire genome. By analyzing nucleotide co-occurrence over the entire genome of human H3N2 viruses, we have developed a network model to describe H3N2 virus evolutionary patterns and dynamics. The network model effectively captures the evolutionary antigenic features of H3N2 virus at the whole-genome level and accurately describes the complex evolutionary patterns between individual gene segments. Our analyses show that the co-occurring nucleotide modules apparently underpin the dynamics of human H3N2 evolution and that amino acid substitutions corresponding to nucleotide co-changes cluster preferentially in known antigenic regions of the viral HA. Therefore, our study demonstrates that nucleotide co-occurrence networks represent a powerful method for tracking influenza A virus evolution and that cooperative genomic interaction is a major force underlying influenza virus evolution.</abstract><remote-database-name>genome.cshlp.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/1/178</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\5HYJDTDK\Du et al. - 2008 - Networks of genomic co-occurrence capture characte.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18032723</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\9EJKJ82U\178.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-13 00:11:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Deng, Lizong</author><author>Liu, Mi</author><author>Hua, Sha</author><author>Peng, Yousong</author><author>Wu, Aiping</author><author>Qin, F.

As more phage genomes are published, new methods are needed for placing these genomes in an ecological and evolutionary context. Phages are difficult to study by phylogenetic methods, because they exchange genes regularly, and no single gene is conserved across all phages. Here, we demonstrate how gene-level networks can provide a high-resolution view of phage genetic diversity and offer a novel perspective on virus ecology. We focus our analyses on virus host range and show how network topology corresponds to host relatedness, how to find groups of genes with the strongest host-specific signatures, and how this perspective can complement phage host prediction tools. We discuss extensions of gene network analysis to predicting the emergence of phages on new hosts, as well as applications to features of phage biology beyond host range.&#xD;IMPORTANCE Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect bacteria, and they are critical drivers of bacterial evolution and community structure. It is generally difficult to study phages by using tree-based methods, because gene exchange is common, and no single gene is shared among all phages. Instead, networks offer a means to compare phages while placing them in a broader ecological and evolutionary context. In this work, we build a network that summarizes gene sharing across phages and test how a key constraint on phage ecology, host range, corresponds to the structure of the network. We find that the network reflects the relatedness among phage hosts, and phages with genes that are closer in the network are likelier to infect similar hosts. This approach can also be used to identify genes that affect host range, and we discuss possible extensions to analyze other aspects of viral ecology.</abstract><remote-database-name>mbio.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://mbio.asm.org/content/9/2/e01870-17</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\LSYHL7IQ\Shapiro and Putonti - 2018 - Gene Co-occurrence Networks Reflect Bacteriophage .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29559574</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\D68LZEDJ\e01870-17.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-13 00:45:13</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tillier, Elisabeth R.

It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.pnas.org/content/108/49/E1293</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\LXZ2RQ6C\Morcos et al. - 2011 - Direct-coupling analysis of residue coevolution ca.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22106262</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\JL2F3IPV\E1293.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-13 01:22:44</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>The CRyPTIC Consortium and the 100, 000 Genomes Project</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction of Susceptibility to First-Line Tuberculosis Drugs by DNA Sequencing</title><secondary-title>New England Journal of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New England Journal of Medicine</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-09-26</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMoa1800474</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Original Article from The New England Journal of Medicine — Prediction of Susceptibility to First-Line Tuberculosis Drugs by DNA Sequencing</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nejm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1800474</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\XJDJRIXF\NEJMoa1800474.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-13 01:30:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Chan Yeong</author><author>Lee, Insuk</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Functional gene networks based on the gene neighborhood in metagenomes</title><secondary-title>Animal Cells and Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Animal Cells and Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>301-306</pages><volume>21</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Metagenome</keyword><keyword>functional gene network</keyword><keyword>gene neighborhood</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>September 3, 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1976-8354</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/19768354.2017.1382388</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The gene neighborhood in prokaryotic genomes has been effectively utilized in inferring co-functional networks in various organisms. Previously, such genomic context information has been sought among completely assembled prokaryotic genomes. Here, we present a method to infer functional gene networks according to the gene neighborhood in metagenome contigs, which are incompletely assembled genomic fragments. Given that the amount of metagenome sequence data has now surpassed that of completely assembled prokaryotic genomes in the public domain, we expect benefits of inferring networks by the metagenome-based gene neighborhood. We generated co-functional networks for diverse taxonomical species using metagenomics contigs derived from the human microbiome and the ocean microbiome. We found that the networks based on the metagenome gene neighborhood outperformed those based on 1748 completely assembled prokaryotic genomes. We also demonstrated that the metagenome-based gene neighborhood could predict genes related to virulence-associated phenotypes in a bacterial pathogen, indicating that metagenome-based functional links could be sufficiently predictive for some phenotypes of medical importance. Owing to the exponential growth of metagenome sequence data in public repositories, metagenome-based inference of co-functional networks will facilitate understanding of gene functions and pathways in diverse species.</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2017.1382388</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\YY6S9TC2\Kim and Lee - 2017 - Functional gene networks based on the gene neighbo.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\KXKQW7A7\19768354.2017.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-13 03:14:52</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, Haiyuan</author><author>Luscombe, Nicholas M.</author><author>Lu, Hao Xin</author><author>Zhu, Xiaowei</author><author>Xia, Yu</author><author>Han, Jing-Dong J.</author><author>Bertin, Nicolas</author><author>Chung, Sambath</author><author>Vidal, Marc</author><author>Gerstein, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Annotation Transfer Between Genomes: Protein–Protein Interologs and Protein–DNA Regulogs</title><secondary-title>Genome Research</secondary-title><short-title>Annotation Transfer Between Genomes</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Research</full-title><abbr-1>Genome Res.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1107-1118</pages><volume>14</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>06/01/2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1088-9051, 1549-5469</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.1774904</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Proteins function mainly through interactions, especially with DNA and other proteins. While some large-scale interaction networks are now available for a number of model organisms, their experimental generation remains difficult. Consequently, interolog mapping—the transfer of interaction annotation from one organism to another using comparative genomics—is of significant value. Here we quantitatively assess the degree to which interologs can be reliably transferred between species as a function of the sequence similarity of the corresponding interacting proteins. Using interaction information from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Helicobacter pylori, we find that protein–protein interactions can be transferred when a pair of proteins has a joint sequence identity &gt;80% or a joint E-value &lt;10–70. (These “joint” quantities are the geometric means of the identities or E-values for the two pairs of interacting proteins.) We generalize our interolog analysis to protein–DNA binding, finding such interactions are conserved at specific thresholds between 30% and 60% sequence identity depending on the protein family. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a “regulog”—a conserved regulatory relationship between proteins across different species. We map interologs and regulogs from yeast to a number of genomes with limited experimental annotation (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana) and make these available through an online database at http://interolog.gersteinlab.org. Specifically, we are able to transfer ∼90,000 potential protein–protein interactions to the worm. We test a number of these in two-hybrid experiments and are able to verify 45 overlaps, which we show to be statistically significant.</abstract><remote-database-name>genome.cshlp.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://genome.cshlp.org/content/14/6/1107</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3ZWG7GEL\Yu et al. - 2004 - Annotation Transfer Between Genomes Protein–Prote.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15173116</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\8CZBX7HD\1107.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-13 03:47:39</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pavithra, Soundara Raghavan</author><author>Kumar, Ranjit</author><author>Tatu, Utpal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Systems Analysis of Chaperone Networks in the Malarial Parasite Plasmodium falciparum</title><secondary-title>PLOS Computational Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS Computational Biology</full-title><abbr-1>PLOS Computational Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e168</pages><volume>3</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Chaperone proteins</keyword><keyword>Heat shock response</keyword><keyword>Malarial parasites</keyword><keyword>Parasitic life cycles</keyword><keyword>Plasmodium</keyword><keyword>Protein interaction networks</keyword><keyword>Protein interactions</keyword><keyword>Yeast two-hybrid assays</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>Sep 14, 2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1553-7358</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030168</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Molecular chaperones participate in the maintenance of cellular protein homeostasis, cell growth and differentiation, signal transduction, and development. Although a vast body of information is available regarding individual chaperones, few studies have attempted a systems level analysis of chaperone function. In this paper, we have constructed a chaperone interaction network for the malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. P. falciparum is responsible for several million deaths every year, and understanding the biology of the parasite is a top priority. The parasite regularly experiences heat shock as part of its life cycle, and chaperones have often been implicated in parasite survival and growth. To better understand the participation of chaperones in cellular processes, we created a parasite chaperone network by combining experimental interactome data with in silico analysis. We used interolog mapping to predict protein–protein interactions for parasite chaperones based on the interactions of corresponding human chaperones. This data was then combined with information derived from existing high-throughput yeast two-hybrid assays. Analysis of the network reveals the broad range of functions regulated by chaperones. The network predicts involvement of chaperones in chromatin remodeling, protein trafficking, and cytoadherence. Importantly, it allows us to make predictions regarding the functions of hypothetical proteins based on their interactions. It allows us to make specific predictions about Hsp70–Hsp40 interactions in the parasite and assign functions to members of the Hsp90 and Hsp100 families. Analysis of the network provides a rational basis for the anti-malarial activity of geldanamycin, a well-known Hsp90 inhibitor. Finally, analysis of the network provides a theoretical basis for further experiments designed toward understanding the involvement of this important class of molecules in parasite biology.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030168</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\VQJI3QY6\Pavithra et al. - 2007 - Systems Analysis of Chaperone Networks in the Mala.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\77H7YMKB\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-13 03:52:58</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharma, Vikas</author><author>Mobeen, Fauzul</author><author>Prakash, Tulika</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploration of Survival Traits, Probiotic Determinants, Host Interactions, and Functional Evolution of Bifidobacterial Genomes Using Comparative Genomics</title><secondary-title>Genes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genes</full-title><abbr-1>Genes (Basel)</abbr-1></periodical><volume>9</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-10-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2073-4425</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/genes9100477</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Members of the genus Bifidobacterium are found in a wide-range of habitats and are used as important probiotics. Thus, exploration of their functional traits at the genus level is of utmost significance. Besides, this genus has been demonstrated to exhibit an open pan-genome based on the limited number of genomes used in earlier studies. However, the number of genomes is a crucial factor for pan-genome calculations. We have analyzed the pan-genome of a comparatively larger dataset of 215 members of the genus Bifidobacterium belonging to different habitats, which revealed an open nature. The pan-genome for the 56 probiotic and human-gut strains of this genus, was also found to be open. The accessory- and unique-components of this pan-genome were found to be under the operation of Darwinian selection pressure. Further, their genome-size variation was predicted to be attributed to the abundance of certain functions carried by genomic islands, which are facilitated by insertion elements and prophages. In silico functional and host-microbe interaction analyses of their core-genome revealed significant genomic factors for niche-specific adaptations and probiotic traits. The core survival traits include stress tolerance, biofilm formation, nutrient transport, and Sec-secretion system, whereas the core probiotic traits are imparted by the factors involved in carbohydrate- and protein-metabolism and host-immunomodulations.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6210967/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\H3RF5UHI\Sharma et al. - 2018 - Exploration of Survival Traits, Probiotic Determin.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6210967/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-13 03:54:02</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huo, Tong</author><author>Liu, Wei</author><author>Guo, Yu</author><author>Yang, Cheng</author><author>Lin, Jianping</author><author>Rao, Zihe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction of host - pathogen protein interactions between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Homo sapiens using sequence motifs</title><secondary-title>BMC Bioinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Bioinformatics</full-title><abbr-1>BMC Bioinformatics</abbr-1></periodical><volume>16</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015-3-26</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2105</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12859-015-0535-y</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background&#xD;Emergence of multiple drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB) threatens to derail global efforts aimed at reigning in the pathogen. Co-infections of M. tuberculosis with HIV are difficult to treat. To counter these new challenges, it is essential to study the interactions between M. tuberculosis and the host to learn how these bacteria cause disease.&#xD;&#xD;Results&#xD;We report a systematic flow to predict the host pathogen interactions (HPIs) between M. tuberculosis and Homo sapiens based on sequence motifs. First, protein sequences were used as initial input for identifying the HPIs by ‘interolog’ method. HPIs were further filtered by prediction of domain-domain interactions (DDIs). Functional annotations of protein and publicly available experimental results were applied to filter the remaining HPIs. Using such a strategy, 118 pairs of HPIs were identified, which involve 43 proteins from M. tuberculosis and 48 proteins from Homo sapiens. A biological interaction network between M. tuberculosis and Homo sapiens was then constructed using the predicted inter- and intra-species interactions based on the 118 pairs of HPIs. Finally, a web accessible database named PATH (Protein interactions of M. tuberculosis and Human) was constructed to store these predicted interactions and proteins.&#xD;&#xD;Conclusions&#xD;This interaction network will facilitate the research on host-pathogen protein-protein interactions, and may throw light on how M. tuberculosis interacts with its host.&#xD;&#xD;Electronic supplementary material&#xD;The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0535-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4456996/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ECJRELST\Huo et al. - 2015 - Prediction of host - pathogen protein interactions.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4456996/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-13 03:55:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Corander, Jukka</author><author>Fraser, Christophe</author><author>Gutmann, Michael U.</author><author>Arnold, Brian</author><author>Hanage, William P.</author><author>Bentley, Stephen D.</author><author>Lipsitch, Marc</author><author>Croucher, Nicholas J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Frequency-dependent selection in vaccine-associated pneumococcal population dynamics</title><secondary-title>Nature Ecology &amp;

When regulation is not optimal, mutations that change gene expression can contribute to antibiotic resistance. It is not systematically understood to what extent natural gene regulation is or is not optimal for distinct antibiotics, and how changes in expression of speciﬁc genes quantitatively affect antibiotic resistance. Here we discover a simple quantitative relation between ﬁtness, gene expression, and antibiotic potency, which rationalizes our observation that a multitude of genes and even innate antibiotic defense mechanisms have expression that is critically nonoptimal under antibiotic treatment. First, we developed a pooled-strain drug-diffusion assay and screened Escherichia coli overexpression and knockout libraries, ﬁnding that resistance to a range of 31 antibiotics could result from changing expression of a large and functionally diverse set of genes, in a primarily but not exclusively drug-speciﬁc manner. Second, by synthetically controlling the expression of single-drug and multidrug resistance genes, we observed that their ﬁtness–expression functions changed dramatically under antibiotic treatment in accordance with a log-sensitivity relation. Thus, because many genes are nonoptimally expressed under antibiotic treatment, many regulatory mutations can contribute to resistance by altering expression and by activating latent defenses.</abstract><remote-database-name>Crossref</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msy163/5085501</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NLMCLCSP\Palmer et al. - 2018 - Nonoptimal Gene Expression Creates Latent Potentia.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-22 11:46:53</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lees, John A.</author><author>Vehkala, Minna</author><author>Välimäki, Niko</author><author>Harris, Simon R.</author><author>Chewapreecha, Claire</author><author>Croucher, Nicholas J.</author><author>Marttinen, Pekka</author><author>Davies, Mark R.</author><author>Steer, Andrew C.</author><author>Tong, Steven Y.

Pan-genome studies provide a framework for estimating the genomic diversity of the dataset, determining core (conserved), accessory (dispensable) and unique (strain-specific) gene pool of a species, tracing horizontal gene-flux across strains and providing insight into species evolution. The existing pan genome software tools suffer from various limitations like limited datasets, difficult installation/requirements, inadequate functional features etc. Here we present an ultra-fast computational pipeline BPGA (Bacterial Pan Genome Analysis tool) with seven functional modules. In addition to the routine pan genome analyses, BPGA introduces a number of novel features for downstream analyses like core/pan/MLST (Multi Locus Sequence Typing) phylogeny, exclusive presence/absence of genes in specific strains, subset analysis, atypical G + C content analysis and KEGG &amp; COG mapping of core, accessory and unique genes. Other notable features include minimum running prerequisites, freedom to select the gene clustering method, ultra-fast execution, user friendly command line interface and high-quality graphics outputs. The performance of BPGA has been evaluated using a dataset of complete genome sequences of 28 Streptococcus pyogenes strains.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4829868/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\F9WL3YZD\Chaudhari et al. - 2016 - BPGA- an ultra-fast pan-genome analysis pipeline.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4829868/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-28 16:25:15</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Seif, Yara</author><author>Kavvas, Erol</author><author>Lachance, Jean-Christophe</author><author>Yurkovich, James T.</author><author>Nuccio, Sean-Paul</author><author>Fang, Xin</author><author>Catoiu, Edward</author><author>Raffatellu, Manuela</author><author>Palsson, Bernhard O.</author><author>Monk, Jonathan M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of multiple Salmonella strains reveal serovar-specific metabolic traits</title><secondary-title>Nature Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Communications</full-title><abbr-1>Nat Commun</abbr-1></periodical><volume>9</volume><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-9-14</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2041-1723</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-018-06112-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Salmonella strains are traditionally classified into serovars based on their surface antigens. While increasing availability of whole-genome sequences has allowed for more detailed subtyping of strains, links between genotype, serovar, and host remain elusive. Here we reconstruct genome-scale metabolic models for 410 Salmonella strains spanning 64 serovars. Model-predicted growth capabilities in over 530 different environments demonstrate that: (1) the Salmonella accessory metabolic network includes alternative carbon metabolism, and cell wall biosynthesis; (2) metabolic capabilities correspond to each strain’s serovar and isolation host; (3) growth predictions agree with 83.1% of experimental outcomes for 12 strains (690 out of 858); (4) 27 strains are auxotrophic for at least one compound, including l-tryptophan, niacin, l-histidine, l-cysteine, and p-aminobenzoate; and (5) the catabolic pathways that are important for fitness in the gastrointestinal environment are lost amongst extraintestinal serovars. Our results reveal growth differences that may reflect adaptation to particular colonization sites., Salmonella serovars colonize a wide range of hosts but the underlying genetic determinants remain poorly understood. Here, Seif et al. use a network-based computational analysis to link specific metabolic capabilities with host range and nutritional niche.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6138749/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\EEF3AGQA\Seif et al. - 2018 - Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of multiple.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6138749/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-28 16:27:18</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raven, Kathy E.</author><author>Reuter, Sandra</author><author>Gouliouris, Theodore</author><author>Reynolds, Rosy</author><author>Russell, Julie E.</author><author>Brown, Nicholas M.</author><author>Török, M.

We undertook whole genome sequencing of E. faecalis associated with bloodstream infection in the UK and Ireland over more than a decade to determine the population structure and genetic associations with hospital adaptation. Three lineages predominated in the population, two of which (L1 and L2) were nationally distributed, and one (L3) geographically restricted. Genome comparison with a global collection identified that L1 and L3 were also present in the USA, but were genetically distinct. Over 90% of VREfs belonged to L1–L3, with resistance acquired and lost multiple times in L1 and L2, but only once followed by clonal expansion in L3. Putative virulence and antibiotic resistance genes were over-represented in L1, L2 and L3 isolates combined, versus the remainder. Each of the three main lineages contained a mixture of vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible E. faecalis (VSEfs), which has important implications for infection control and antibiotic stewardship.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol201533</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TJ5UTE4N\Raven et al. - 2016 - Genome-based characterization of hospital-adapted .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\X3L83TRE\nmicrobiol201533.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-28 16:30:38</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmid, Michael</author><author>Muri, Jonathan</author><author>Melidis, Damianos</author><author>Varadarajan, Adithi R.</author><author>Somerville, Vincent</author><author>Wicki, Adrian</author><author>Moser, Aline</author><author>Bourqui, Marc</author><author>Wenzel, Claudia</author><author>Eugster-Meier, Elisabeth</author><author>Frey, Juerg E.</author><author>Irmler, Stefan</author><author>Ahrens, Christian H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative Genomics of Completely Sequenced Lactobacillus helveticus Genomes Provides Insights into Strain-Specific Genes and Resolves Metagenomics Data Down to the Strain Level</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Front.

Based on an assessment of the genome assembly complexity for all lactobacilli, we used Pacific Biosciences’ long read technology to sequence and de novo assemble the genomes of three Lactobacillus helveticus starter strains, raising the number of completely sequenced strains to 12. The first comparative genomics study for L. helveticus - to our knowledge - identified a core genome of 988 genes and sets of unique, strain-specific genes ranging from about 30 to more than 200 genes. Importantly, the comparison of MiSeq- and PacBio-based assemblies uncovered that not only accessory but also core genes can be missed in incomplete genome assemblies based on short reads. Analysis of the three genomes revealed that a large number of pseudogenes were enriched for functional Gene Ontology categories such as amino acid transmembrane transport and carbohydrate metabolism, which is in line with a reductive genome evolution in the rich natural habitat of L. helveticus. Notably, the functional Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins categories “cell wall/membrane biogenesis” and “defense mechanisms” were found to be enriched among the strain-specific genes. A genome mining effort uncovered examples where an experimentally observed phenotype could be linked to the underlying genotype, such as for cell envelope proteinase PrtH3 of strain FAM8627. Another possible link identified for peptidoglycan hydrolases will require further experiments. Of note, strain FAM22155 did not harbor a CRISPR/Cas system; its loss was also observed in other L. helveticus strains and lactobacillus species, thus questioning the value of the CRISPR/Cas system for diagnostic purposes. Importantly, the complete genome sequences proved to be very useful for the analysis of natural whey starter cultures with metagenomics, as a larger percentage of the sequenced reads of these complex mixtures could be unambiguously assigned down to the strain level.</abstract><remote-database-name>Frontiers</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00063/full</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\CCJ2ZYWN\Schmid et al. - 2018 - Comparative Genomics of Completely Sequenced Lacto.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2019-02-28 16:32:38</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jain, Miten</author><author>Olsen, Hugh E.</author><author>Paten, Benedict</author><author>Akeson, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Oxford Nanopore MinION: delivery of nanopore sequencing to the genomics community</title><secondary-title>Genome Biology</secondary-title><short-title>The Oxford Nanopore MinION</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Genome Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>239</pages><volume>17</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>November 25, 2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1474-760X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13059-016-1103-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Nanopore DNA strand sequencing has emerged as a competitive, portable technology.

This uncertainty makes building robust classiﬁcation systems problematic. We show that it is possible to build a hybrid classiﬁer that will perform at least as well as the best available classiﬁer for any target conditions. In some cases, the performance of the hybrid actually can surpass that of the best known classiﬁer. This robust performance extends across a wide variety of comparison frameworks, including the optimization of metrics such as accuracy, expected cost, lift, precision, recall, and workforce utilization. The hybrid also is efﬁcient to build, to store, and to update. The hybrid is based on a method for the comparison of classiﬁer performance that is robust to imprecise class distributions and misclassiﬁcation costs. The ROC convex hull (ROCCH) method combines techniques from ROC analysis, decision analysis and computational geometry, and adapts them to the particulars of analyzing learned classiﬁers. The method is efﬁcient and incremental, minimizes the management of classiﬁer performance data, and allows for clear visual comparisons and sensitivity analyses. Finally, we point to empirical evidence that a robust hybrid classiﬁer indeed is needed for many real-world problems.</abstract><remote-database-name>Zotero</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6GWF9T2D\Provost and Fawcett - Robust Classification for Imprecise Environments.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Colangeli, Roberto</author><author>Jedrey, Hannah</author><author>Kim, Soyeon</author><author>Connell, Roy</author><author>Ma, Shuyi</author><author>Chippada Venkata, Uma D.</author><author>Chakravorty, Soumitesh</author><author>Gupta, Aditi</author><author>Sizemore, Erin E.</author><author>Diem, Lois</author><author>Sherman, David R.</author><author>Okwera, Alphonse</author><author>Dietze, Reynaldo</author><author>Boom, W.

We postulated that by analyzing pretreatment isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis obtained from patients who subsequently had a relapse or were cured, we could determine any correlations between the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a drug below the standard resistance breakpoint and the relapse risk after treatment.&#xD;METHODS Using data from the Tuberculosis Trials Consortium Study 22 (development cohort), we assessed relapse and cure isolates to determine the MIC values of isoniazid and rifampin that were below the standard resistance breakpoint (0.1 μg per milliliter for isoniazid and 1.0 μg per milliliter for rifampin). We combined this analysis with clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data to generate predictive relapse models, which we validated by analyzing data from the DMID 01-009 study (validation cohort).

The corresponding MIC values of rifampin were 0.0695±0.0276 and 0.0453±0.0223 μg per milliliter, respectively, which represented a higher value in the relapse group by a factor of 1.53 (P&lt;0.001). Higher MIC values remained associated with relapse in a multivariable analysis that included other significant between-group differences. In an analysis of receiver-operating-characteristic curves of relapse based on these MIC values, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.779. In the development cohort, the AUC in a multivariable model that included MIC values was 0.875. In the validation cohort, the MIC values either alone or combined with other patient characteristics were also predictive of relapse, with AUC values of 0.964 and 0.929, respectively. The use of a model score for the MIC values of isoniazid and rifampin to achieve 75.0% sensitivity in cross-validation analysis predicted relapse with a specificity of 76.5% in the development cohort and a sensitivity of 70.0% and a specificity of 100% in the validation cohort.&#xD;CONCLUSIONS In pretreatment isolates of M. tuberculosis with decrements of MIC values of isoniazid or rifampin below standard resistance breakpoints, higher MIC values were associated with a greater risk of relapse than lower MIC values.

Yet, even for the Escherichia coli TRN—probably the best characterized TRN—several questions remain. Here, we address three questions: (i) How complete is our knowledge of the E. coli TRN; (ii) how well can we predict gene expression using this TRN; and (iii) how robust is our understanding of the TRN? First, we reconstructed a high-confidence TRN (hiTRN) consisting of 147 transcription factors (TFs) regulating 1,538 transcription units (TUs) encoding 1,764 genes. The 3,797 high-confidence regulatory interactions were collected from published, validated chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data and RegulonDB. For 21 different TF knockouts, up to 63% of the differentially expressed genes in the hiTRN were traced to the knocked-out TF through regulatory cascades. Second, we trained supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the expression of 1,364 TUs given TF activities using 441 samples. The algorithms accurately predicted condition-specific expression for 86% (1,174 of 1,364) of the TUs, while 193 TUs (14%) were predicted better than random TRNs. Third, we identified 10 regulatory modules whose definitions were robust against changes to the TRN or expression compendium. Using surrogate variable analysis, we also identified three unmodeled factors that systematically influenced gene expression. Our computational workflow comprehensively characterizes the predictive capabilities and systems-level functions of an organism’s TRN from disparate data types.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.pnas.org/content/114/38/10286</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\E9BFHIU6\Fang et al. - 2017 - Global transcriptional regulatory network for Esch.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874552</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\5HEUJGME\10286.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-04-05 16:44:54</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jeong, H.</author><author>Tombor, B.</author><author>Albert, R.</author><author>Oltvai, Z.

However, despite the key role of these networks in sustaining cellular functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Here we present a systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variation in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems2. This may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks2,3,4,5, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>En</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/35036627</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\KBQHN6FF\Jeong et al. - 2000 - The large-scale organization of metabolic networks.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\EZ79S62W\35036627.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-04-05 16:48:14</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cloonan, Nicole</author><author>Forrest, Alistair R.

Here we use a generic ‘dual RNA-seq’ approach to profile RNA expression simultaneously in pathogen and host during Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection and reveal the molecular impact of bacterial riboregulators. We identify a PhoP-activated small RNA, PinT, which upon bacterial internalization temporally controls the expression of both invasion-associated effectors and virulence genes required for intracellular survival. This riboregulatory activity causes pervasive changes in coding and noncoding transcripts of the host. Interspecies correlation analysis links PinT to host cell JAK–STAT signalling, and we identify infection-specific alterations in multiple long noncoding RNAs. Our study provides a paradigm for a sensitive RNA-based analysis of intracellular bacterial pathogens and their hosts without physical separation, as well as a new discovery route for hidden functions of pathogen genes.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16547</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\K6LSPL83\Westermann et al. - 2016 - Dual RNA-seq unveils noncoding RNA functions in ho.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3N8KKHYK\nature16547.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-04-05 17:17:04</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khaledi, Ariane</author><author>Schniederjans, Monika</author><author>Pohl, Sarah</author><author>Rainer, Roman</author><author>Bodenhofer, Ulrich</author><author>Xia, Boyang</author><author>Klawonn, Frank</author><author>Bruchmann, Sebastian</author><author>Preusse, Matthias</author><author>Eckweiler, Denitsa</author><author>Dötsch, Andreas</author><author>Häussler, Susanne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transcriptome Profiling of Antimicrobial Resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title><secondary-title>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</full-title></periodical><pages>4722-4733</pages><volume>60</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016/08/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0066-4804, 1098-6596</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/AAC.00075-16</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Emerging resistance to antimicrobials and the lack of new antibiotic drug candidates underscore the need for optimization of current diagnostics and therapies to diminish the evolution and spread of multidrug resistance. As the antibiotic resistance status of a bacterial pathogen is defined by its genome, resistance profiling by applying next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies may in the future accomplish pathogen identification, prompt initiation of targeted individualized treatment, and the implementation of optimized infection control measures. In this study, qualitative RNA sequencing was used to identify key genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance in 135 clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from diverse geographic and infection site origins. By applying transcriptome-wide association studies, adaptive variations associated with resistance to the antibiotic classes fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and β-lactams were identified. Besides potential novel biomarkers with a direct correlation to resistance, global patterns of phenotype-associated gene expression and sequence variations were identified by predictive machine learning approaches. Our research serves to establish genotype-based molecular diagnostic tools for the identification of the current resistance profiles of bacterial pathogens and paves the way for faster diagnostics for more efficient, targeted treatment strategies to also mitigate the future potential for resistance evolution.</abstract><remote-database-name>aac.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://aac.asm.org/content/60/8/4722</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\22FVK5NA\Khaledi et al. - 2016 - Transcriptome Profiling of Antimicrobial Resistanc.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27216077</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\EGRIAU3M\4722.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-04-05 17:24:04</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mook, Stella</author><author>Veer, Laura J.

Since breast cancer tumors with similar clinicopathological characteristics can have strikingly different outcomes, the current selection for adjuvant chemotherapy is far from accurate. Using high-throughput microarray analysis, a 70-gene signature was identified which can accurately select early stage breast cancer patients who are highly likely to develop distant metastases, and therefore, may benefit the most from adjuvant chemotherapy.

The procedure employs a new Tn-seq methodology based on the generation and amplification of single-strand circles carrying transposon junction sequences (the Tn-seq circle method), a method which can be used with virtually any transposon. The procedure reliably identified more than 100,000 transposon insertions in a single experiment, providing near-saturation coverage of the genome. To test the effectiveness of the procedure for mutant identification, we screened for mutations reducing intrinsic resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin. Intrinsic tobramycin resistance had been previously analyzed at genome scale using mutant-by-mutant screening and thus provided a benchmark for evaluating the new method. The new Tn-seq procedure identified 117 tobramycin resistance genes, the majority of which were then verified with individual mutants. The group of genes with the strongest mutant phenotypes included nearly all (13 of 14) of those with strong mutant phenotypes identified in the previous screening, as well as a nearly equal number of new genes. The results thus show the effectiveness of the Tn-seq method in defining the genetic basis of a complex resistance trait of P. aeruginosa and indicate that it can be used to analyze a variety of growth-related processes.&#xD;IMPORTANCE Research progress in microbiology is technology limited in the sense that the analytical methods available dictate how questions are experimentally addressed and, to some extent, what questions are asked. This report describes a new transposon tracking procedure for defining the genetic basis of growth-related processes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important bacterial pathogen. The method employs next-generation sequencing to monitor the makeup of mutant populations (Tn-seq) and has several potential advantages over other Tn-seq methodologies. The new method was validated through the analysis of a clinically relevant antibiotic resistance trait.</abstract><remote-database-name>mbio.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://mbio.asm.org/content/2/1/e00315-10</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\HKTCCJTN\Gallagher et al. - 2011 - Genome-Scale Identification of Resistance Function.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21253457</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\UER9IRHR\e00315-10.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-04-25 14:26:42</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Opijnen, Tim van</author><author>Camilli, Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A fine scale phenotype–genotype virulence map of a bacterial pathogen</title><secondary-title>Genome Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Research</full-title><abbr-1>Genome Res.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2541-2551</pages><volume>22</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>12/01/2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1088-9051, 1549-5469</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.137430.112</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A large fraction of the genes from sequenced organisms are of unknown function. This limits biological insight, and for pathogenic microorganisms hampers the development of new approaches to battle infections. There is thus a great need for novel strategies that link genotypes to phenotypes for microorganisms. We describe a high-throughput strategy based on the method Tn-seq that can be applied to any genetically manipulatable microorganism. By screening 17 in vitro and two in vivo (carriage and infection) conditions for the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, we create a resource consisting of &gt;1800 interactions that is rich in new genotype–phenotype relationships. We describe genes that are involved in differential carbon source utilization in the host, as well as genes that are involved both in virulence and in resistance against specific in vitro stresses, thereby revealing selection pressures that the pathogen experiences in vivo. We reveal the secondary response to an antibiotic, including a dual role efflux pump also involved in resistance to pH stress. Through genetic-interaction mapping and gene-expression analysis we define the mechanism of attenuation and the regulatory relationship between a two-component system and a core biosynthetic pathway specific to microorganisms. Thus, we have generated a resource that provides detailed insight into the biology and virulence of S. pneumoniae and provided a road map for similar discovery in other microorganisms.</abstract><remote-database-name>genome.cshlp.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://genome.cshlp.org/content/22/12/2541</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\PY35TMXM\Opijnen and Camilli - 2012 - A fine scale phenotype–genotype virulence map of a.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22826510</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\NRAS4UEL\2541.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-04-25 14:26:49</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Opijnen, Tim</author><author>Bodi, Kip L.</author><author>Camilli, Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tn-seq: high-throughput parallel sequencing for fitness and genetic interaction studies in microorganisms</title><secondary-title>Nature Methods</secondary-title><short-title>Tn-seq</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Methods</full-title></periodical><pages>767-772</pages><volume>6</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1548-7105</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nmeth.1377</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Biological pathways are structured in complex networks of interacting genes. Solving the architecture of such networks may provide valuable information, such as how microorganisms cause disease. Here we present a method (Tn-seq) for accurately determining quantitative genetic interactions on a genome-wide scale in microorganisms. Tn-seq is based on the assembly of a saturated Mariner transposon insertion library. After library selection, changes in frequency of each insertion mutant are determined by sequencing the flanking regions en masse. These changes are used to calculate each mutant's fitness. Using this approach, we determined fitness for each gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a causative agent of pneumonia and meningitis. A genome-wide screen for genetic interactions of five query genes identified both alleviating and aggravating interactions that could be divided into seven distinct categories. Owing to the wide activity of the Mariner transposon, Tn-seq has the potential to contribute to the exploration of complex pathways across many different species.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1377</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\YGP8BLQI\van Opijnen et al. - 2009 - Tn-seq high-throughput parallel sequencing for fi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\9R6XP7PF\nmeth.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-04-25 14:46:01</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCoy, Katherine Maia</author><author>Antonio, Margaret L.</author><author>van Opijnen, Tim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MAGenTA: a Galaxy implemented tool for complete Tn-Seq analysis and data visualization</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics</secondary-title><short-title>MAGenTA</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics</full-title><abbr-1>Bioinformatics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>2781-2783</pages><volume>33</volume><number>17</number><issue>17</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017/09/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1367-4803</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btx320</electronic-resource-num><abstract>AbstractMotivation.

The objective of our studies is to identify better biomarkers for early detection of PCA using protein profiling technologies that can simultaneously resolve and analyze multiple proteins. Evaluating multiple proteins will be essential to establishing signature proteomic patterns that distinguish cancer from noncancer as well as identify all genetic subtypes of the cancer and their biological activity. In this study, we used a protein biochip surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry approach coupled with an artificial intelligence learning algorithm to differentiate PCA from noncancer cohorts. Surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry protein profiles of serum from 167 PCA patients, 77 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia, and 82 age-matched unaffected healthy men were used to train and develop a decision tree classification algorithm that used a nine-protein mass pattern that correctly classified 96% of the samples. A blinded test set, separated from the training set by a stratified random sampling before the analysis, was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the classification system. A sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 97%, and a positive predictive value of 96% for the study population and 91% for the general population were obtained when comparing the PCA versus noncancer (benign prostate hyperplasia/healthy men) groups. This high-throughput proteomic classification system will provide a highly accurate and innovative approach for the early detection/diagnosis of PCA.</abstract><remote-database-name>cancerres.aacrjournals.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/62/13/3609</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\95HMI9WX\Adam et al. - 2002 - Serum Protein Fingerprinting Coupled with a Patter.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12097261</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\V3TSRFHK\3609.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-04-25 15:53:36</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yimer, Solomon A.</author><author>Birhanu, Alemayehu G.</author><author>Kalayou, Shewit</author><author>Riaz, Tahira</author><author>Zegeye, Ephrem D.</author><author>Beyene, Getachew T.</author><author>Holm-Hansen, Carol</author><author>Norheim, Gunnstein</author><author>Abebe, Markos</author><author>Aseffa, Abraham</author><author>Tønjum, Tone</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative Proteomic Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Lineage 7 and Lineage 4 Strains Reveals Differentially Abundant Proteins Linked to Slow Growth and Virulence</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Front.

The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour1,2,3. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70–80% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it4,5. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date6,7,8,9,10,11,12 allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases (‘poor prognosis’ signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>En</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/415530a</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\DWL7RA6L\Veer et al. - 2002 - Gene expression profiling predicts clinical outcom.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\W5ZG5SMV\415530a.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-05-09 19:22:46</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Opijnen, Tim</author><author>Camilli, Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transposon insertion sequencing: a new tool for systems-level analysis of microorganisms</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Microbiology</secondary-title><short-title>Transposon insertion sequencing</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>435-442</pages><volume>11</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1740-1534</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrmicro3033</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Our knowledge of gene function has increasingly lagged behind gene discovery, hindering our understanding of the genetic basis of microbial phenotypes.

Accurate predictions on bacterial survival and adaptive outcomes could thus have great diagnostic and prognostic value, both in terms of antibiotic susceptibility testing - or more complex - the monitoring of an active infection. However, it is for instance unknown what information would enable such predictions. Here we present a substantial experimental data set that we train a suite of new predictive models on that vary in their complexity and amount and type of data required. The two simplest models are gene panel centered and predict an antibiotic’s mechanism of action, and the survival outcome of Streptococcus pneumoniae in a specific environment. However, since gene panels quickly become species, strain and/or environment specific we mine the dataset and implement the generalizable feature ‘entropy’ to quantify the extent of transcriptional disruption that occurs during exposure to an environment. We exploit entropy in a highly generalizable machine learning model and show that it accurately captures a bacterium’s future trajectory with respect to survival outcome, and irrespective of strain, species or environment. Moreover, the inclusion of a varied-set of multi-omics features of the bacterial stress response further enhances survival predictions by reducing ambiguity. Lastly, by combining our data that accurately maps out stress that occurs throughout the bacterium on multiple organizational levels during environmental stress, with data that describes genome-wide evolutionary constraints, and machine learning we design an approach that allows for the prediction of adaptive mutations under environmental selection (including antibiotics), highlighting that adaptive evolution is at least partially predictable. By demonstrating the feasibility of predictions on bacterial survival and adaptive outcomes this work forms an exciting opportunity to improve infectious disease prognostics and a priori identification of the emergence of antibiotic resistance.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Tonder, Andries J.</author><author>Bray, James E.</author><author>Jolley, Keith A.</author><author>Jansen van Rensburg, Melissa</author><author>Quirk, Sigríður J.</author><author>Haraldsson, Gunnsteinn</author><author>Maiden, Martin C.

Estimating the core genome (those genes common to all, or nearly all, strains of a species) is a key component of such analyses. The size and composition of the core genome varies by dataset, but we hypothesised that the variation between different collections of the same bacterial species would be minimal. To investigate this, we analysed the genome sequences of 3,118 pneumococci recovered from healthy individuals in Reykjavik (Iceland), Southampton (United Kingdom), Boston (USA) and Maela (Thailand). The analyses revealed a ‘supercore’ genome (genes shared by all 3,118 pneumococci) of 558 genes, although an additional 354 core genes were shared by pneumococci from Reykjavik, Southampton and Boston. Overall, the size and composition of the core and pan-genomes among pneumococci recovered in Reykjavik, Southampton and Boston were similar. Maela pneumococci were distinctly different in that they had a smaller core genome and larger pan-genome. The pan-genome of Maela pneumococci contained several &gt;25 Kb sequence regions (flanked by pneumococcal genes) that were homologous to genomic regions found in other bacterial species. Overall, our work revealed that some subsets of the global pneumococcal population are highly heterogeneous, and our hypothesis was rejected. This is an important finding in terms of understanding genetic variation among pneumococci and is also an essential point of consideration before generalising the findings from a single dataset to the wider pneumococcal population.</abstract><remote-database-name>Frontiers</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00317/full</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\DS42BB5N\van Tonder et al. - 2019 - Genomic Analyses of 3,100 Nasopharyngeal Pneumoco.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2019-05-13 19:56:18</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lees, John A.</author><author>Harris, Simon R.</author><author>Tonkin-Hill, Gerry</author><author>Gladstone, Rebecca A.</author><author>Lo, Stephanie W.</author><author>Weiser, Jeffrey N.</author><author>Corander, Jukka</author><author>Bentley, Stephen D.</author><author>Croucher, Nicholas J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fast and flexible bacterial genomic epidemiology with PopPUNK</title><secondary-title>Genome Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genome Research</full-title><abbr-1>Genome Res.</abbr-1></periodical><pages>304-316</pages><volume>29</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>02/01/2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1088-9051, 1549-5469</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/gr.241455.118</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The routine use of genomics for disease surveillance provides the opportunity for high-resolution bacterial epidemiology. Current whole-genome clustering and multilocus typing approaches do not fully exploit core and accessory genomic variation, and they cannot both automatically identify, and subsequently expand, clusters of significantly similar isolates in large data sets spanning entire species. Here, we describe PopPUNK (Population Partitioning Using Nucleotide K-mers), a software implementing scalable and expandable annotation- and alignment-free methods for population analysis and clustering. Variable-length k-mer comparisons are used to distinguish isolates’ divergence in shared sequence and gene content, which we demonstrate to be accurate over multiple orders of magnitude using data from both simulations and genomic collections representing 10 taxonomically widespread species. Connections between closely related isolates of the same strain are robustly identified, despite interspecies variation in the pairwise distance distributions that reflects species’ diverse evolutionary patterns. PopPUNK can process 103–104 genomes in a single batch, with minimal memory use and runtimes up to 200-fold faster than existing model-based methods. Clusters of strains remain consistent as new batches of genomes are added, which is achieved without needing to reanalyze all genomes de novo. This facilitates real-time surveillance with consistent cluster naming between studies and allows for outbreak detection using hundreds of genomes in minutes. Interactive visualization and online publication is streamlined through the automatic output of results to multiple platforms. PopPUNK has been designed as a flexible platform that addresses important issues with currently used whole-genome clustering and typing methods, and has potential uses across bacterial genetics and public health research.</abstract><remote-database-name>genome.cshlp.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://genome.cshlp.org/content/29/2/304</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3FCUDDPE\Lees et al. - 2019 - Fast and flexible bacterial genomic epidemiology w.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679308</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TR3SYRGF\304.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-05-13 22:17:42</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Poulsen, Bradley E.</author><author>Yang, Rui</author><author>Clatworthy, Anne E.</author><author>White, Tiantian</author><author>Osmulski, Sarah J.</author><author>Li, Li</author><author>Penaranda, Cristina</author><author>Lander, Eric S.</author><author>Shoresh, Noam</author><author>Hung, Deborah T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Defining the core essential genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>PNAS</abbr-1></periodical><pages>201900570</pages><keywords><keyword>ESKAPE</keyword><keyword>antibiotic discovery</keyword><keyword>gram-negative pathogens</keyword><keyword>Tn-Seq</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019/04/29</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0027-8424, 1091-6490</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1900570116</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Genomics offered the promise of transforming antibiotic discovery by revealing many new essential genes as good targets, but the results fell short of the promise. While numerous factors contributed to the disappointing yield, one factor was that essential genes for a bacterial species were often defined based on a single or limited number of strains grown under a single or limited number of in vitro laboratory conditions. In fact, the essentiality of a gene can depend on both the genetic background and growth condition. We thus developed a strategy for more rigorously defining the core essential genome of a bacterial species by studying many pathogen strains and growth conditions. We assessed how many strains must be examined to converge on a set of core essential genes for a species. We used transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-Seq) to define essential genes in nine strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on five different media and developed a statistical model, FiTnEss, to classify genes as essential versus nonessential across all strain–medium combinations. We defined a set of 321 core essential genes, representing 6.6% of the genome. We determined that analysis of four strains was typically sufficient in P. aeruginosa to converge on a set of core essential genes likely to be essential across the species across a wide range of conditions relevant to in vivo infection, and thus to represent attractive targets for novel drug discovery.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/04/26/1900570116</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\43WFWSEJ\Poulsen et al. - 2019 - Defining the core essential genome of Pseudomonas .pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31036669</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\YPXQI6QB\1900570116.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-05-13 22:17:47</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Yongbing</author><author>Wu, Jiayan</author><author>Yang, Junhui</author><author>Sun, Shixiang</author><author>Xiao, Jingfa</author><author>Yu, Jun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PGAP: pan-genomes analysis pipeline</title><secondary-title>Bioinformatics</secondary-title><short-title>PGAP</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioinformatics</full-title><abbr-1>Bioinformatics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>416-418</pages><volume>28</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012/02/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1367-4803</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/bioinformatics/btr655</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract.

Unfortunately, the sequence of a single genome does not reflect how genetic variability drives pathogenesis within a bacterial species and also limits genome-wide screens for vaccine candidates or for antimicrobial targets. We have generated the genomic sequence of six strains representing the five major disease-causing serotypes of Streptococcus agalactiae, the main cause of neonatal infection in humans. Analysis of these genomes and those available in databases showed that the S. agalactiae species can be described by a pan-genome consisting of a core genome shared by all isolates, accounting for ≈80% of any single genome, plus a dispensable genome consisting of partially shared and strain-specific genes. Mathematical extrapolation of the data suggests that the gene reservoir available for inclusion in the S. agalactiae pan-genome is vast and that unique genes will continue to be identified even after sequencing hundreds of genomes.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.pnas.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.pnas.org/content/102/39/13950</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\66U7BCKI\Tettelin et al. - 2005 - Genome analysis of multiple pathogenic isolates of.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16172379</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\A9ZD8CHU\13950.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-05-20 15:07:26</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stevens, Marc J.

Information on B. cytotoxicus is very limited; in particular comprehensive genomic data is lacking. Thus, we applied a genomic approach to characterize B. cytotoxicus and decipher its population structure. To this end, complete genomes of ten B. cytotoxicus were sequenced and compared to the four publicly available full B. cytotoxicus genomes and genomes of other B. cereus group members. Average nucleotide identity, core genome, and pan genome clustering resulted in clear distinction of B. cytotoxicus strains from other strains of the B. cereus group. Genomic content analyses showed that a hydroxyphenylalanine operon is present in B. cytotoxicus, but absent in all other members of the B. cereus group. It enables degradation of aromatic compounds to succinate and pyruvate and was likely acquired from another Bacillus species. It allows for utilization of tyrosine and might have given a B. cytotoxicus ancestor an evolutionary advantage resulting in species differentiation. Plasmid content showed that B. cytotoxicus is flexible in exchanging genes, allowing for quick adaptation to the environment. Genome-based phylogenetic analyses divided the B. cytotoxicus strains into four clades that also differed in virulence gene content.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6374410/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\WBZBRKPV\Stevens et al. - 2019 - Whole-genome-based phylogeny of Bacillus cytotoxic.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6374410/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-05-20 15:53:10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghattargi, Vikas C.</author><author>Gaikwad, Meghana A.</author><author>Meti, Bharati S.</author><author>Nimonkar, Yogesh S.</author><author>Dixit, Kunal</author><author>Prakash, Om</author><author>Shouche, Yogesh S.</author><author>Pawar, Shrikant P.</author><author>Dhotre, Dhiraj P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative genome analysis reveals key genetic factors associated with probiotic property in Enterococcus faecium strains</title><secondary-title>BMC Genomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Genomics</full-title><abbr-1>BMC Genomics</abbr-1></periodical><volume>19</volume><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-9-4</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2164</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s12864-018-5043-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background&#xD;Enterococcus faecium though commensal in the human gut, few strains provide a beneficial effect to humans as probiotics while few are responsible for the nosocomial infection. Comparative genomics of E. faecium can decipher the genomic differences responsible for probiotic, pathogenic and non-pathogenic properties. In this study, we compared E. faecium strain 17OM39 with a marketed probiotic, non-pathogenic non-probiotic (NPNP) and pathogenic strains.&#xD;&#xD;Results&#xD;E. faecium 17OM39 was found to be closely related with marketed probiotic strain T110 based on core genome analysis. Strain 17OM39 was devoid of known vancomycin, tetracycline resistance and functional virulence genes. Moreover, E. faecium 17OM39 genome was found to be more stable due to the absence of frequently found transposable elements. Genes imparting beneficial functional properties were observed to be present in marketed probiotic T110 and 17OM39 strains. Genes associated with colonization and survival within gastrointestinal tract was also detected across all the strains.&#xD;&#xD;Conclusions&#xD;Beyond shared genetic features; this study particularly identified genes that are responsible for imparting probiotic, non-pathogenic and pathogenic features to the strains of E. faecium. Higher genomic stability, absence of known virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes and close genomic relatedness with marketed probiotics makes E. faecium 17OM39 a potential probiotic candidate. The work presented here demonstrates that comparative genome analyses can be applied to large numbers of genomes, to find potential probiotic candidates.&#xD;&#xD;Electronic supplementary material&#xD;The online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-018-5043-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6122445/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TMX438MA\Ghattargi et al. - 2018 - Comparative genome analysis reveals key genetic fa.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6122445/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-05-20 15:54:10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tierney, Lanay</author><author>Linde, Jörg</author><author>Müller, Sebastian</author><author>Brunke, Sascha</author><author>Molina, Juan Camilo</author><author>Hube, Bernhard</author><author>Schöck, Ulrike</author><author>Guthke, Reinhard</author><author>Kuchler, Karl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Interspecies Regulatory Network Inferred from Simultaneous RNA-seq of Candida albicans Invading Innate Immune Cells</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Front.

We have quantified C.albicans and M. musculus gene expression dynamics during phagocytosis by dendritic cells in a genome-wide, time-resolved analysis using simultaneous RNA-seq. A robust network inference map was generated from this dataset using NetGenerator, predicting novel interactions between the host and the pathogen. We experimentally verified predicted interdependent sub-networks comprising Hap3 in C. albicans, and Ptx3 and Mta2 in M. musculus. Remarkably, binding of recombinant Ptx3 to the C. albicans cell wall was found to regulate the expression of fungal Hap3 target genes as predicted by the network inference model. Pre-incubation of C. albicans with recombinant Ptx3 significantly altered the expression of Mta2 target cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-4 in a Hap3-dependent manner, further suggesting a role for Mta2 in host-pathogen interplay as predicted in the network inference model. We propose an integrated model for the functionality of these sub-networks during fungal invasion of immune cells, according to which binding of Ptx3 to the C. albicans cell wall induces remodelling via fungal Hap3 target genes, thereby altering the immune response to the pathogen. We show the applicability of network inference to predict interactions between host-pathogen pairs, demonstrating the usefulness of this systems biology approach to decipher mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis.</abstract><remote-database-name>Frontiers</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00085/full</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\GK4L23K4\Tierney et al. - 2012 - An Interspecies Regulatory Network Inferred from S.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2019-05-30 17:37:03</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rowe, Hannah M.</author><author>Karlsson, Erik</author><author>Echlin, Haley</author><author>Chang, Ti-Cheng</author><author>Wang, Lei</author><author>van Opijnen, Tim</author><author>Pounds, Stanley B.</author><author>Schultz-Cherry, Stacey</author><author>Rosch, Jason W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bacterial Factors Required for Transmission of Streptococcus pneumoniae in Mammalian Hosts</title><secondary-title>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</full-title><abbr-1>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</abbr-1></periodical><keywords><keyword>ferret</keyword><keyword>influenza</keyword><keyword>transmission</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>May 21, 2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1931-3128</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chom.2019.04.012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Summary&#xD;The capacity of Streptococcus pneumoniae to successfully transmit and colonize new human hosts is a critical aspect of pneumococcal population biology and a prerequisite for invasive disease. However, the bacterial mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. To identify bacterial factors required for transmission, we conducted a high-throughput genetic screen with a transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) library of a pneumococcal strain in a ferret transmission model. Key players in both metabolism and transcriptional regulation were identified as required for efficient bacterial transmission. Targeted deletion of the putative C3-degrading protease CppA, iron transporter PiaA, or competence regulatory histidine kinase ComD significantly decreased transmissibility in a mouse model, further validating the screen. Maternal vaccination with recombinant surface-exposed PiaA and CppA alone or in combination blocked transmission in offspring and were more effective than capsule-based vaccines. These data underscore the possibility of targeting pneumococcal transmission as a means of eliminating invasive disease in the population.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193131281930215X</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\38ZUMHTZ\Rowe et al. - 2019 - Bacterial Factors Required for Transmission of Str.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ZF5I2PCA\S193131281930215X.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-06-03 19:33:26</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Westermann, Alexander J.</author><author>Gorski, Stanislaw A.</author><author>Vogel, Jörg</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dual RNA-seq of pathogen and host</title><secondary-title>Nature Reviews Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Reviews Microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>618-630</pages><volume>10</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1740-1534</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nrmicro2852</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A comprehensive understanding of host–pathogen interactions requires a knowledge of the associated gene expression changes in both the pathogen and the host.

Here, we assess the feasibility of taking transcriptomics one step further by performing 'dual RNA-seq', in which gene expression changes in both the pathogen and the host are analysed simultaneously.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro2852</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\FUAC78VP\Westermann et al. - 2012 - Dual RNA-seq of pathogen and host.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SKJ2MMGK\nrmicro2852.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-06-03 21:27:44</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horinouchi, Takaaki</author><author>Suzuki, Shingo</author><author>Kotani, Hazuki</author><author>Tanabe, Kumi</author><author>Sakata, Natsue</author><author>Shimizu, Hiroshi</author><author>Furusawa, Chikara</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction of Cross-resistance and Collateral Sensitivity by Gene Expression profiles and Genomic Mutations</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title><abbr-1>Sci Rep</abbr-1></periodical><volume>7</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-10-25</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2045-2322</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-017-14335-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In adaptive evolution, an increase in fitness to an environment is frequently accompanied by changes in fitness to other environmental conditions, called cross-resistance and sensitivity. Although the networks between fitness changes affect the course of evolution substantially, the mechanisms underlying such fitness changes are yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, we performed high-throughput laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli under various stress conditions using an automated culture system, and quantified how the acquisition of resistance to one stressor alters the resistance to other stressors. We demonstrated that resistance changes could be quantitatively predicted based on changes in the transcriptome of the resistant strains. We also identified several genes and gene functions, for which mutations were commonly fixed in the strains resistant to the same stress, which could partially explain the observed cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity. The integration of transcriptome and genome data enabled us to clarify the bacterial stress resistance mechanisms.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5656584/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\E6NW5MQ4\Horinouchi et al. - 2017 - Prediction of Cross-resistance and Collateral Sens.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5656584/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-06-17 15:29:17</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chatterji, Dipankar</author><author>Kumar Ojha, Anil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Revisiting the stringent response, ppGpp and starvation signaling</title><secondary-title>Current Opinion in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current Opinion in Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Current Opinion in Microbiology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>160-165</pages><volume>4</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>bacteria</keyword><keyword>virulence</keyword><keyword>eukaryotes</keyword><keyword>persistance</keyword><keyword>ppGpp</keyword><keyword>sporulation</keyword><keyword>starvation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>April 1, 2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1369-5274</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S1369-5274(00)00182-X</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Microbial adaptation to environmental stress plays an important role in survival. It is necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying the survival of microbes under stress, as they may eventually aid in the successful control of the growth and persistence of these organisms. During nutrient starvation, Escherichia coli elicits a stringent response to conserve energy. The hallmark of the stringent response is the accumulation of guanosine tetra- (ppGpp) and pentaphosphates (pppGpp), which probably bind RNA polymerase to regulate gene expression at certain promoters. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the stringent responses of other microbes, with a view to correlating it with sporulation, virulence and long-term persistence.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136952740000182X</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\XTK3AQLU\Chatterji and Kumar Ojha - 2001 - Revisiting the stringent response, ppGpp and starv.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\KHYVWI9R\S136952740000182X.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-06-17 16:21:52</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Erill, Ivan</author><author>Campoy, Susana</author><author>Barbé, Jordi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aeons of distress: an evolutionary perspective on the bacterial SOS response</title><secondary-title>FEMS Microbiology Reviews</secondary-title><short-title>Aeons of distress</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FEMS Microbiology Reviews</full-title><abbr-1>FEMS Microbiol Rev</abbr-1></periodical><pages>637-656</pages><volume>31</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007/11/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0168-6445</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1574-6976.2007.00082.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract.

This can be accomplished through stochastic mechanisms, where individual cells within a population display diverse phenotypes to hedge against the appearance of an antibiotic. To date, research on transient stochastic resistance has focused primarily on mechanisms where a subpopulation of cells enters a dormant, drug-tolerant state. However, a fundamental question is whether stochastic gene expression can also generate variable resistance levels among growing cells in a population. We hypothesized that stochastic expression of antibiotic-inducible resistance mechanisms might play such a role. To investigate this, we focused on a prototypical example of such a system: the multiple antibiotic resistance activator MarA. Previous studies have shown that induction of MarA can lead to a multidrug resistant phenotype at the population level. We asked whether MarA expression also has a stochastic component, even when uninduced. Time lapse microscopy showed that isogenic cells express heterogeneous, dynamic levels of MarA, which were correlated with transient antibiotic survival. This finding has important clinical implications, as stochastic expression of resistance genes may be widespread, allowing populations to hedge against the sudden appearance of an antibiotic.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4725842/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\5QW9LVA6\El Meouche et al. - 2016 - Stochastic expression of a multiple antibiotic res.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4725842/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-06-17 17:17:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Okusu, H</author><author>Ma, D</author><author>Nikaido, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>AcrAB efflux pump plays a major role in the antibiotic resistance phenotype of Escherichia coli multiple-antibiotic-resistance (Mar) mutants.</title><secondary-title>Journal of Bacteriology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Bacteriology</full-title><abbr-1>J Bacteriol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>306-308</pages><volume>178</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996-1</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-9193</isbn><abstract>Multiple-antibiotic-resistance (Mar) mutants of Escherichia coli are resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics, and increased active efflux is known to be responsible for the resistance to some drugs.

It is based on the uptake and integration of exogenous DNA into the recipient genome. This review examines whether induction of competence for genetic transformation is a general response to stress in gram-positive bacteria. It compares data obtained with bacteria chosen for their different lifestyles, the soil-dweller Bacillus subtilis and the major human pathogen S. pneumoniae. The review focuses on the relationship between competence and other global responses in B. subtilis, as well as on recent evidence for competence induction in response to DNA damage or antibiotics and for the ability of S. pneumoniae to use competence as a substitute for SOS. This comparison reveals that the two species use different fitness-enhancing strategies in response to stress conditions. Whereas B. subtilis combines competence and SOS induction, S. pneumoniae relies only on competence to generate genetic diversity through transformation.</abstract><remote-database-name>Annual Reviews</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.micro.60.080805.142139</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\DE9HZEWX\Claverys et al. - 2006 - Induction of Competence Regulons as a General Resp.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2019-06-17 17:54:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goltermann, Lise</author><author>Good, Liam</author><author>Bentin, Thomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chaperonins Fight Aminoglycoside-induced Protein Misfolding and Promote Short-term Tolerance in Escherichia coli</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Biological Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Biological Chemistry</full-title><abbr-1>J Biol Chem</abbr-1></periodical><pages>10483-10489</pages><volume>288</volume><number>15</number><issue>15</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-4-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-9258</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1074/jbc.M112.420380</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Aminoglycoside antibiotics cause misreading during mRNA translation., Results: Aminoglycoside action resulted in misfolding of newly synthesized proteins, and chaperonins helped Escherichia coli cope with this insult., Conclusion: Chaperonins fight aminoglycoside-induced protein misfolding., Significance: The study shows how chaperones can increase bacterial tolerance to aminoglycoside antibiotics., For almost half of a century, we have known that aminoglycoside antibiotics corrupt ribosomes, causing translational misreading, yet it remains unclear whether or not misreading triggers protein misfolding, and possible effects of chaperone action on drug susceptibilities are poorly understood. Here, we show that aminoglycosides cause cytosolic protein misfolding and that chaperonin GroEL/GroES overexpression counters this defect. During aminoglycoside exposure to exponential cultures, chaperonin overexpression protected the bacterial membrane potential, rescued cell growth, and facilitated survival, whereas inhibition of chaperonin expression sensitized bacteria. Overexpression of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system similarly facilitated survival but did not promote growth of aminoglycoside-treated bacteria. Inhibition of chaperonin expression sensitized bacteria to aminoglycosides as measured by reduced minimum inhibitory concentrations, whereas GroEL/GroES overexpression did not increase minimum inhibitory concentrations. Our observations establish misfolding of cytosolic proteins as an effect of aminoglycoside action and reveal that chaperones, chaperonins in particular, help bacteria cope during early exposure to these drugs.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3624430/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\7BCGI4Z2\Goltermann et al. - 2013 - Chaperonins Fight Aminoglycoside-induced Protein M.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3624430/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-06-17 23:24:02</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goltermann, Lise</author><author>Sarusie, Menachem V.</author><author>Bentin, Thomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chaperonin GroEL/GroES Over-Expression Promotes Aminoglycoside Resistance and Reduces Drug Susceptibilities in Escherichia coli Following Exposure to Sublethal Aminoglycoside Doses</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Front Microbiol</abbr-1></periodical><volume>6</volume><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-1-26</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1664-302X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fmicb.2015.01572</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Antibiotic resistance is an increasing challenge to modern healthcare.

We investigated the roles of the DnaK (Hsp70), DnaJ and GrpE chaperones of Escherichia coli in prevention and repair of thermally induced protein damage using firefly luciferase as a test substrate. In vivo, luciferase was rapidly inactivated at 42 degrees C, but was efficiently reactivated to 50% of its initial activity during subsequent incubation at 30 degrees C. DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE did not prevent luciferase inactivation, but were essential for its reactivation. In vitro, reactivation of heat-inactivated luciferase to 80% of its initial activity required the combined activity of DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE as well as ATP, but not GroEL and GroES. DnaJ associated with denatured luciferase, targeted DnaK to the substrate and co-operated with DnaK to prevent luciferase aggregation at 42 degrees C, an activity that was required for subsequent reactivation. The protein repair function of DnaK, GrpE and, in particular, DnaJ is likely to be part of the role of these proteins in regulation of the heat shock response.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC413706/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\DITV9URT\Schröder et al. - 1993 - DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE form a cellular chaperone mach.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC413706/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-06-20 16:40:30</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cardoso, K.</author><author>Gandra, R.

Despite this, etiologic LRTI pathogens are infrequently identified due to limitations of existing microbiologic tests. In critically ill patients, noninfectious inflammatory syndromes resembling LRTIs further complicate diagnosis. To address the need for improved LRTI diagnostics, we performed metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) on tracheal aspirates from 92 adults with acute respiratory failure and simultaneously assessed pathogens, the airway microbiome, and the host transcriptome. To differentiate pathogens from respiratory commensals, we developed a rules-based model (RBM) and logistic regression model (LRM) in a derivation cohort of 20 patients with LRTIs or noninfectious acute respiratory illnesses. When tested in an independent validation cohort of 24 patients, both models achieved accuracies of 95.5%. We next developed pathogen, microbiome diversity, and host gene expression metrics to identify LRTI-positive patients and differentiate them from critically ill controls with noninfectious acute respiratory illnesses. When tested in the validation cohort, the pathogen metric performed with an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.86–1.00), the diversity metric with an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.63–0.98), and the host transcriptional classifier with an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.75–1.00). Combining these achieved a negative predictive value of 100%. This study suggests that a single streamlined protocol offering an integrated genomic portrait of pathogen, microbiome, and host transcriptome may hold promise as a tool for LRTI diagnosis.</abstract><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1809700115</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3TES69DS\Langelier et al. - 2018 - Integrating host response and unbiased microbe det.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2019-06-24 15:35:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yimer, Solomon A</author><author>Birhanu, Alemayehu G</author><author>Kalayou, Shewit</author><author>Riaz, Tahira</author><author>Zegeye, Ephrem D</author><author>Beyene, Getachew T</author><author>Holm-Hansen, Carol</author><author>Norheim, Gunnstein</author><author>Abebe, Markos</author><author>Aseffa, Abraham</author><author>Tønjum, Tone</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative Proteomic Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Lineage 7 and Lineage 4 Strains Reveals Differentially Abundant Proteins Linked to Slow Growth and Virulence</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Front Microbiol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>795-795</pages><volume>8</volume><keywords><keyword>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</keyword><keyword>mass spectrometry</keyword><keyword>Ethiopia</keyword><keyword>lineage 7</keyword><keyword>type 7 secretion</keyword><keyword>proteomics</keyword><keyword>tuberculosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>May 9, 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1664-302X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fmicb.2017.00795</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In order to decipher the nature of the slowly growing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tuberculosis) lineage 7, the differentially abundant proteins in strains of M. tuberculosis lineage 7 and lineage 4 were defined.

A combined total of 2867 protein groups covering 71% of the predicted M. tuberculosis proteome were identified. The abundance of 125 proteins in M. tuberculosis lineage 7 and 4 strains was significantly altered. Notably, the analysis showed that a number of M. tuberculosis proteins involved in growth and virulence were less abundant in lineage 7 strains compared to lineage 4. Five ABC transporter proteins, three phosphate binding proteins essential for inorganic phosphate uptake, and six components of the type 7 secretion system ESX-3 involved in iron acquisition were less abundant in M. tuberculosis lineage 7. This proteogenomic analysis provided an insight into the lineage 7-specific protein profile which may provide clues to understanding the differential properties of lineage 7 strains in terms of slow growth, survival fitness, and pathogenesis.</abstract><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28536560</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5423352/</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Bin</author><author>Horvath, Steve</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A general framework for weighted gene co-expression network analysis.</title><secondary-title>Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology</full-title><abbr-1>Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>Article17</pages><volume>4</volume><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1544-6115 1544-6115</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2202/1544-6115.1128</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0).  We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.</abstract><language>eng</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cock, Peter J.

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large.

The process is the engine for the graph clustering algorithm called the MCL algorithm. The MCL process takes a stochastic matrix as input, and then alternates expansion and inflation, each step defining a stochastic matrix in terms of the previous one. Expansion corresponds with taking the kth power of a stochastic matrix, where $k\in\N$. Inflation corresponds with a parametrized operator $\Gamma_r$, $r\geq 0$, that maps the set of (column) stochastic matrices onto itself. The image $\Gamma_r M$ is obtained by raising each entry in M to the rth power and rescaling each column to have sum 1 again. In practice the process converges very fast towards a limit that is invariant under both matrix multiplication and inflation, with quadratic convergence around the limit points. The heuristic behind the process is its expected behavior for (Markov) graphs possessing cluster structure. The process is typically applied to the matrix of random walks on a given graph G, and the connected components of (the graph associated with) the process limit generically allow a clustering interpretation of G. The limit is in general extremely sparse and iterands are sparse in a weighted sense, implying that the MCL algorithm is very fast and highly scalable. Several mathematical properties of the MCL process are established. Most notably, the process (and algorithm) iterands posses structural properties generalizing the mapping from process limits onto clusterings. The inflation operator $\Gamma_r$ maps the class of matrices that are diagonally similar to a symmetric matrix onto itself. The phrase diagonally positive semi-definite (dpsd) is used for matrices that are diagonally similar to a positive semi-definite matrix. For $r\in\N$ and for M a stochastic dpsd matrix, the image $\Gamma_r M$ is again dpsd. Determinantal inequalities satisfied by a dpsd matrix M imply a natural ordering among the diagonal elements of M, generalizing the mapping of process limits onto clusterings. The spectrum of $\Gamma_{\infty} M$ is of the form $\{0^{n-k}, 1^k\}$, where k is the number of endclasses of the ordering associated with M, and n is the dimension of M. This attests to the uncoupling effect of the inflation operator.</abstract><remote-database-name>epubs.siam.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/040608635</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\6RRGGIXC\040608635.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-07-04 13:00:41</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Strehl, Alexander</author><author>Ghosh, Joydeep</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cluster Ensembles – A Knowledge Reuse Framework for Combining Multiple Partitions</title></titles><pages>35</pages><dates/><abstract>This paper introduces the problem of combining multiple partitionings of a set of objects into a single consolidated clustering without accessing the features or algorithms that determined these partitionings. We ﬁrst identify several application scenarios for the resultant ‘knowledge reuse’ framework that we call cluster ensembles. The cluster ensemble problem is then formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem in terms of shared mutual information. In addition to a direct maximization approach, we propose three eﬀective and eﬃcient techniques for obtaining high-quality combiners (consensus functions). The ﬁrst combiner induces a similarity measure from the partitionings and then reclusters the objects. The second combiner is based on hypergraph partitioning. The third one collapses groups of clusters into meta-clusters which then compete for each object to determine the combined clustering. Due to the low computational costs of our techniques, it is quite feasible to use a supra-consensus function that evaluates all three approaches against the objective function and picks the best solution for a given situation. We evaluate the effectiveness of cluster ensembles in three qualitatively diﬀerent application scenarios: (i) where the original clusters were formed based on non-identical sets of features, (ii) where the original clustering algorithms worked on non-identical sets of objects, and (iii) where a common data-set is used and the main purpose of combining multiple clusterings is to improve the quality and robustness of the solution. Promising results are obtained in all three situations for synthetic as well as real data-sets.</abstract><remote-database-name>Zotero</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3YTNQRQV\Strehl and Ghosh - Cluster Ensembles – A Knowledge Reuse Framework fo.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Munkres, James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Algorithms for the Assignment and Transportation Problems</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics</full-title></periodical><pages>32-38</pages><volume>5</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1957</year><pub-dates><date>1957</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0368-4245</isbn><remote-database-name>JSTOR</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.jstor.org/stable/2098689</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2019-07-04 13:04:14</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tan, Pang-Ning</author><author>Steinbach, Michael</author><author>Karpatne, Anuj</author><author>Kumar, Vipin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Introduction to Data Mining (2Nd Edition)</title></titles><edition>2nd</edition><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Pearson</publisher><isbn>978-0-13-312890-1</isbn><abstract>Introducing the fundamental concepts and algorithms of data mining Introduction to Data Mining, 2nd Edition, gives a comprehensive overview of the background and general themes of data mining and is designed to be useful to students, instructors, researchers, and professionals.

PCV13 replaced PCV7 in April 2010. As carriage precedes disease cases this study collected carried pneumococci from children each winter from 2006/7 to 2010/11 over PCV introduction. Conventional microbiology and whole genome sequencing were utilised to characterise pneumococcal strains. Overall prevalence of pneumococcal carriage remained stable. Vaccine serotypes (VT) decreased (p&lt;0.0001) with concomitant increases in non-vaccine serotypes (NVT). In winter 2010/11 only one isolate of PCV7 VT was observed (6B). PCV13 unique VTs decreased between winters immediately preceding and following PCV13 introduction (p=0.04). Significant decreases for VTs 6B, 19F, 23F (PCV7) and 6A (PCV13) and increases for NVT 21, 23B, 33F and 35F were detected. The serotype replacement was accompanied by parallel changes in genotype prevalence for associated sequence types with clonal expansion contributing to replacement. By winter 2010/11, serotype coverage of PCV7 and PCV13 was 1% and 11% respectively. VT replacement was observed for PCV7 and PCV13 serotypes.

Three lineages predominated in the population, two of which (L1 and L2) were nationally distributed, and one (L3) geographically restricted. Genome comparison with a global collection identified that L1 and L3 were also present in the USA, but were genetically distinct. Over 90% of VREfs belonged to L1–L3, with resistance acquired and lost multiple times in L1 and L2, but only once followed by clonal expansion in L3. Putative virulence and antibiotic resistance genes were over-represented in L1, L2 and L3 isolates combined, versus the remainder.

Despite fundamental changes in Earth’s redox state, there are very few comprehensive, proteome-wide analyses about the effects of these changes on gene content and evolution. Here, using a pan-proteome sequence similarity network applied to broadly sampled lifestyles of 84 prokaryotes that were categorized into four different redox groups (i.e., methanogens, obligate anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, and obligate aerobes), we reconstructed the genetic inventory of major respiratory communities. We show that a set of putative core homologs that is highly conserved in prokaryotic proteomes is characterized by the loss of canonical network connections and low conductance that correlates with differences in respiratory phenotypes. We suggest these different network patterns observed for different respiratory communities could be explained by two major evolutionary diversification events in the history of microbial life. The first event (M) is a divergence between methanogenesis and other anaerobic lifestyles in prokaryotes (archaebacteria and eubacteria). The second diversification event (OX) is from anaerobic to aerobic lifestyles that left a proteome-wide footprint among prokaryotes. Additional analyses revealed that oxidoreductase evolution played a central role in these two diversification events. Distinct cofactor binding domains were frequently recombined, allowing these enzymes to utilize increasingly oxidized substrates with high specificity.</abstract><remote-database-name>Frontiers</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2014.00072/full</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\XKBLJ9NR\Cheng et al. - 2014 - Sequence similarity network reveals the imprints o.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2019-07-05 14:46:16</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wattam, Alice R.</author><author>Davis, James J.</author><author>Assaf, Rida</author><author>Boisvert, Sébastien</author><author>Brettin, Thomas</author><author>Bun, Christopher</author><author>Conrad, Neal</author><author>Dietrich, Emily M.</author><author>Disz, Terry</author><author>Gabbard, Joseph L.</author><author>Gerdes, Svetlana</author><author>Henry, Christopher S.</author><author>Kenyon, Ronald W.</author><author>Machi, Dustin</author><author>Mao, Chunhong</author><author>Nordberg, Eric K.</author><author>Olsen, Gary J.</author><author>Murphy-Olson, Daniel E.</author><author>Olson, Robert</author><author>Overbeek, Ross</author><author>Parrello, Bruce</author><author>Pusch, Gordon D.</author><author>Shukla, Maulik</author><author>Vonstein, Veronika</author><author>Warren, Andrew</author><author>Xia, Fangfang</author><author>Yoo, Hyunseung</author><author>Stevens, Rick L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improvements to PATRIC, the all-bacterial Bioinformatics Database and Analysis Resource Center</title><secondary-title>Nucleic Acids Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nucleic Acids Research</full-title><abbr-1>Nucleic Acids Res</abbr-1></periodical><pages>D535-D542</pages><volume>45</volume><number>Database issue</number><issue>Database issue</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-1-04</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0305-1048</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nar/gkw1017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) is the bacterial Bioinformatics Resource Center (https://www.patricbrc.org). Recent changes to PATRIC include a redesign of the web interface and some new services that provide users with a platform that takes them from raw reads to an integrated analysis experience. The redesigned interface allows researchers direct access to tools and data, and the emphasis has changed to user-created genome-groups, with detailed summaries and views of the data that researchers have selected. Perhaps the biggest change has been the enhanced capability for researchers to analyze their private data and compare it to the available public data. Researchers can assemble their raw sequence reads and annotate the contigs using RASTtk. PATRIC also provides services for RNA-Seq, variation, model reconstruction and differential expression analysis, all delivered through an updated private workspace. Private data can be compared by ‘virtual integration’ to any of PATRIC's public data. The number of genomes available for comparison in PATRIC has expanded to over 80 000, with a special emphasis on genomes with antimicrobial resistance data. PATRIC uses this data to improve both subsystem annotation and k-mer classification, and tags new genomes as having signatures that indicate susceptibility or resistance to specific antibiotics.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5210524/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\3HB5JZUR\Wattam et al. - 2017 - Improvements to PATRIC, the all-bacterial Bioinfor.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5210524/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-07-05 14:49:15</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chicco, Davide</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ten quick tips for machine learning in computational biology</title><secondary-title>BioData Mining</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioData Mining</full-title><abbr-1>BioData Min</abbr-1></periodical><volume>10</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-12-8</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1756-0381</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13040-017-0155-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Machine learning has become a pivotal tool for many projects in computational biology, bioinformatics, and health informatics.

Here we show that antibiotic treatment induces substantial changes in the gut microbial community and in the metabolome of mice susceptible to C. difficile infection. Levels of secondary bile acids, glucose, free fatty acids and dipeptides decrease, whereas those of primary bile acids and sugar alcohols increase, reflecting the modified metabolic activity of the altered gut microbiome. In vitro and ex vivo analyses demonstrate that C. difficile can exploit specific metabolites that become more abundant in the mouse gut after antibiotics, including the primary bile acid taurocholate for germination, and carbon sources such as mannitol, fructose, sorbitol, raffinose and stachyose for growth. Our results indicate that antibiotic-mediated alteration of the gut microbiome converts the global metabolic profile to one that favours C. difficile germination and growth.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4114</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\2J6Y72PI\Theriot et al. - 2014 - Antibiotic-induced shifts in the mouse gut microbi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\A8BDFQPP\ncomms4114.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-07-15 18:43:30</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abreu, Clare I.</author><author>Friedman, Jonathan</author><author>Woltz, Vilhelm L.

Upon stimulation by various proinflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin (IL)-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, PGE2 synthesis is upregulated by the expression of cyclooxygenases. Biologically active PGE2 is then able to signal through four primary receptors to elicit a response. PGE2 is a critical molecule that regulates the activation, maturation, migration, and cytokine secretion of several immune cells, particularly those involved in innate immunity such as macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. Both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria can induce PGE2 synthesis to regulate immune responses during bacterial pathogenesis. This review will focus on PGE2 in innate immunity and how bacterial pathogens influence PGE2 production during enteric and pulmonary infections. The conserved ability of many bacterial pathogens to promote PGE2 responses during infection suggests a common signaling mechanism to deter protective pro-inflammatory immune responses. Inhibition of PGE2 production and signaling during infection may represent a therapeutic alternative to treat bacterial infections. Further study of the immunosuppressive effects of PGE2 on innate immunity will lead to a better understanding of potential therapeutic targets within the PGE2 pathway.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3748320/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\22BMTEPK\Agard et al. - 2013 - PGE2 suppression of innate immunity during mucosal.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3748320/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-08-01 13:15:32</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aronoff, David M.</author><author>Canetti, Claudio</author><author>Peters-Golden, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prostaglandin E2 Inhibits Alveolar Macrophage Phagocytosis through an E-Prostanoid 2 Receptor-Mediated Increase in Intracellular Cyclic AMP</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Immunology</full-title></periodical><pages>559-565</pages><volume>173</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004/07/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-1767, 1550-6606</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4049/jimmunol.173.1.559</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Prostaglandin E2 is a potent lipid mediator of inflammation that effects changes in cell functions through ligation of four distinct G protein-coupled receptors (E-prostanoid (EP)1, EP2, EP3, and EP4). During pneumonia, PGE2 production is enhanced. In the present study, we sought to assess the effect of endogenously produced and exogenously added PGE2 on FcRγ-mediated phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens by alveolar macrophages (AMs), which are critical participants in lung innate immunity. We also sought to characterize the EP receptor signaling pathways responsible for these effects. PGE2 (1–1000 nM) dose-dependently suppressed the phagocytosis by rat AMs of IgG-opsonized erythrocytes, immune serum-opsonized Klebsiella pneumoniae, and IgG-opsonized Escherichia coli. Conversely, phagocytosis was stimulated by pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. PGE2 suppression of phagocytosis was associated with enhanced intracellular cAMP production. Experiments using both forskolin (adenylate cyclase activator) and rolipram (phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor) confirmed the inhibitory effect of cAMP stimulation. Immunoblot analysis of rat AMs identified expression of only EP2 and EP3 receptors. The selective EP2 agonist butaprost, but neither the EP1/EP3 agonist sulprostone nor the EP4-selective agonist ONO-AE1-329, mimicked the effects of PGE2 on phagocytosis and cAMP stimulation. Additionally, the EP2 antagonist AH-6809 abrogated the inhibitory effects of both PGE2 and butaprost. We confirmed the specificity of our results by showing that AMs from EP2-deficient mice were resistant to the inhibitory effects of PGE2. Our data support a negative regulatory role for PGE2 on the antimicrobial activity of AMs, which has important implications for future efforts to prevent and treat bacterial pneumonia.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.jimmunol.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.jimmunol.org/content/173/1/559</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\EHV9B3H4\Aronoff et al. - 2004 - Prostaglandin E2 Inhibits Alveolar Macrophage Phag.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15210817</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\Z6LG3A4G\559.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-08-01 14:01:21</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Serezani, Carlos H.</author><author>Chung, Jooho</author><author>Ballinger, Megan N.</author><author>Moore, Bethany B.</author><author>Aronoff, David M.</author><author>Peters-Golden, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prostaglandin E2 Suppresses Bacterial Killing in Alveolar Macrophages by Inhibiting NADPH Oxidase</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>562-570</pages><volume>37</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>November 1, 2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1044-1549</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1165/rcmb.2007-0153OC</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a potent lipid mediator that effects changes in cell functions through ligation of four distinct G protein–coupled E prostanoid (EP) receptors (EP1–EP4). PGE2 inhibits bacterial killing and reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) production by alveolar macrophages (AMs), although little is known about the operative molecular mechanisms. The aims of this study were to evaluate the molecular mechanisms and the specific EP receptors through which PGE2 inhibits killing of Klebsiella pneumoniae by AMs. The treatment of AMs with PGE2 suppressed the killing of K. pneumoniae, and this effect was blocked by an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor and mimicked by agonists for the stimulatory G protein (Gs)-coupled EP2 and EP4 receptors. Conversely, microbicidal activity was augmented by pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, and antagonists of EP2 and EP4. Similar results were found when ROI production was examined. PGE2 inhibition of killing and ROI generation was associated with its activation of the cAMP effectors, protein kinase A and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP-1, as well as attenuation of the phosphorylation and translocation of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase component, p47phox, to the phagosomal membrane.

Recent studies have shown the virulence of competence-deficient mutants to be attenuated, but the nature of the connection between competence and virulence remained unknown. Here we document the release, triggered by competent cells, of virulence factors (e.g., the cytolytic toxin pneumolysin) from noncompetent cells. This phenomenon, which we name allolysis, involves a previously undescribed bacteriocin system consisting of a two-peptide bacteriocin, CibAB, and its immunity factor, CibC; the major autolysin, LytA, and lysozyme, LytC; and a proposed new amidase, CbpD. We show that CibAB are absolutely required for allolysis, whereas LytA and LytC can be supplied either by the competent cells or by the targeted cells. We propose that allolysis constitutes a competence-programmed mechanism of predation of noncompetent cells, which benefits to the competent cells and contributes to virulence by coordinating the release of virulence factors.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\WPHP3T45\Guiral et al. - 2005 - Competence-programmed predation of noncompetent ce.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15928084</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davalos, Dimitrios</author><author>Akassoglou, Katerina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fibrinogen as a key regulator of inflammation in disease</title><secondary-title>Seminars in Immunopathology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Seminars in Immunopathology</full-title><abbr-1>Semin Immunopathol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>43-62</pages><volume>34</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Atherosclerosis</keyword><keyword>Alzheimer’s disease</keyword><keyword>Anticoagulant therapy</keyword><keyword>Autoimmunity</keyword><keyword>Blood brain barrier</keyword><keyword>CD11b/CD18</keyword><keyword>Complement receptor 3</keyword><keyword>Inflammatory disease</keyword><keyword>Macrophages</keyword><keyword>Microglia</keyword><keyword>Multiple sclerosis</keyword><keyword>Plasminogen</keyword><keyword>Rheumatoid arthritis</keyword><keyword>Stroke</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-01-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1863-2300</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00281-011-0290-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The interaction of coagulation factors with the perivascular environment affects the development of disease in ways that extend beyond their traditional roles in the acute hemostatic cascade. Key molecular players of the coagulation cascade like tissue factor, thrombin, and fibrinogen are epidemiologically and mechanistically linked with diseases with an inflammatory component. Moreover, the identification of novel molecular mechanisms linking coagulation and inflammation has highlighted factors of the coagulation cascade as new targets for therapeutic intervention in a wide range of inflammatory human diseases. In particular, a proinflammatory role for fibrinogen has been reported in vascular wall disease, stroke, spinal cord injury, brain trauma, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, bacterial infection, colitis, lung and kidney fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and several types of cancer. Genetic and pharmacologic studies have unraveled pivotal roles for fibrinogen in determining the extent of local or systemic inflammation. As cellular and molecular mechanisms for fibrinogen functions in tissues are identified, the role of fibrinogen is evolving from a marker of vascular rapture to a multi-faceted signaling molecule with a wide spectrum of functions that can tip the balance between hemostasis and thrombosis, coagulation and fibrosis, protection from infection and extensive inflammation, and eventually life and death. This review will discuss some of the main molecular links between coagulation and inflammation and will focus on the role of fibrinogen in inflammatory disease highlighting its unique structural properties, cellular targets, and signal transduction pathways that make it a potent proinflammatory mediator and a potential therapeutic target.</abstract><remote-database-name>Springer Link</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-011-0290-8</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\BWQ8UVRS\Davalos and Akassoglou - 2012 - Fibrinogen as a key regulator of inflammation in d.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2019-08-01 15:40:20</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Damron, F.

This can be due to immunosuppression of the host, immune evasion by the pathogen and/or ineffective killing by antibiotics. Bacteria can survive antibiotic treatment if they are resistant or tolerant to a drug. Persisters are a subpopulation of transiently antibiotic-tolerant bacterial cells that are often slow-growing or growth-arrested, and are able to resume growth after a lethal stress. The formation of persister cells establishes phenotypic heterogeneity within a bacterial population and has been hypothesized to be important for increasing the chances of successfully adapting to environmental change. The presence of persister cells can result in the recalcitrance and relapse of persistent bacterial infections, and it has been linked to an increase in the risk of the emergence of antibiotic resistance during treatment. If the mechanisms of the formation and regrowth of these antibiotic-tolerant cells were better understood, it could lead to the development of new approaches for the eradication of persistent bacterial infections. In this Review, we discuss recent developments in our understanding of bacterial persisters and their potential implications for the treatment of persistent infections.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro.2017.42</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\IEUCESLU\nrmicro.2017.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-08-15 14:18:22</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Orth, Jeffrey D.</author><author>Thiele, Ines</author><author>Palsson, Bernhard Ø.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What is flux balance analysis?</title><secondary-title>Nature biotechnology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature biotechnology</full-title><abbr-1>Nat Biotechnol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>245-248</pages><volume>28</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-3</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1087-0156</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nbt.1614</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Flux balance analysis is a mathematical approach for analyzing the flow of metabolites through a metabolic network.

This updated metabolic reconstruction includes: (1) an alignment with the latest genome annotation and the metabolic content of EcoCyc leading to the inclusion of the activities of 1260 ORFs, (2) characterization and quantification of the biomass components and maintenance requirements associated with growth of E. coli and (3) thermodynamic information for the included chemical reactions. The conversion of this metabolic network reconstruction into an in silico model is detailed. A new step in the metabolic reconstruction process, termed thermodynamic consistency analysis, is introduced, in which reactions were checked for consistency with thermodynamic reversibility estimates. Applications demonstrating the capabilities of the genome-scale metabolic model to predict high-throughput experimental growth and gene deletion phenotypic screens are presented. The increased scope and computational capability using this new reconstruction is expected to broaden the spectrum of both basic biology and applied systems biology studies of E. coli metabolism.</abstract><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1911197/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SBHE6ZTC\Feist et al. - 2007 - A genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for Escher.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1911197/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-08-15 14:24:24</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jorth, Peter</author><author>Turner, Keith H.</author><author>Gumus, Pinar</author><author>Nizam, Nejat</author><author>Buduneli, Nurcan</author><author>Whiteley, Marvin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metatranscriptomics of the Human Oral Microbiome during Health and Disease</title><secondary-title>mBio</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>mBio</full-title></periodical><pages>e01012-14</pages><volume>5</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014/05/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2150-7511</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/mBio.01012-14</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The human microbiome plays important roles in health, but when disrupted, these same indigenous microbes can cause disease. The composition of the microbiome changes during the transition from health to disease; however, these changes are often not conserved among patients. Since microbiome-associated diseases like periodontitis cause similar patient symptoms despite interpatient variability in microbial community composition, we hypothesized that human-associated microbial communities undergo conserved changes in metabolism during disease. Here, we used patient-matched healthy and diseased samples to compare gene expression of 160,000 genes in healthy and diseased periodontal communities. We show that health- and disease-associated communities exhibit defined differences in metabolism that are conserved between patients. In contrast, the metabolic gene expression of individual species was highly variable between patients. These results demonstrate that despite high interpatient variability in microbial composition, disease-associated communities display conserved metabolic profiles that are generally accomplished by a patient-specific cohort of microbes.&#xD;IMPORTANCE The human microbiome project has shown that shifts in our microbiota are associated with many diseases, including obesity, Crohn’s disease, diabetes, and periodontitis. While changes in microbial populations are apparent during these diseases, the species associated with each disease can vary from patient to patient. Taking into account this interpatient variability, we hypothesized that specific microbiota-associated diseases would be marked by conserved microbial community behaviors. Here, we use gene expression analyses of patient-matched healthy and diseased human periodontal plaque to show that microbial communities have highly conserved metabolic gene expression profiles, whereas individual species within the community do not. Furthermore, disease-associated communities exhibit conserved changes in metabolic and virulence gene expression.</abstract><remote-database-name>mbio.asm.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://mbio.asm.org/content/5/2/e01012-14</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\5JRM75JI\Jorth et al. - 2014 - Metatranscriptomics of the Human Oral Microbiome d.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692635</url><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\SSY4A6N9\e01012-14.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-08-15 15:08:09</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bang, Sohyun</author><author>Yoo, DongAhn</author><author>Kim, Soo-Jin</author><author>Jhang, Soyun</author><author>Cho, Seoae</author><author>Kim, Heebal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Establishment and evaluation of prediction model for multiple disease classification based on gut microbial data</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title><abbr-1>Sci Rep</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>9</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-07-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2045-2322</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-019-46249-x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Diseases prediction has been performed by machine learning approaches with various biological data. One of the representative data is the gut microbial community, which interacts with the host’s immune system. The abundance of a few microorganisms has been used as markers to predict diverse diseases. In this study, we hypothesized that multi-classification using machine learning approach could distinguish the gut microbiome from following six diseases: multiple sclerosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, stroke and colorectal cancer. We used the abundance of microorganisms at five taxonomy levels as features in 696 samples collected from different studies to establish the best prediction model. We built classification models based on four multi-class classifiers and two feature selection methods including a forward selection and a backward elimination. As a result, we found that the performance of classification is improved as we use the lower taxonomy levels of features; the highest performance was observed at the genus level. Among four classifiers, LogitBoost–based prediction model outperformed other classifiers. Also, we suggested the optimal feature subsets at the genus-level obtained by backward elimination. We believe the selected feature subsets could be used as markers to distinguish various diseases simultaneously. The finding in this study suggests the potential use of selected features for the diagnosis of several diseases.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-46249-x</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\GJH64HUU\Bang et al. - 2019 - Establishment and evaluation of prediction model f.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\QVXMNL2Y\s41598-019-46249-x.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-08-15 15:15:38</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pasolli, Edoardo</author><author>Truong, Duy Tin</author><author>Malik, Faizan</author><author>Waldron, Levi</author><author>Segata, Nicola</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Machine Learning Meta-analysis of Large Metagenomic Datasets: Tools and Biological Insights</title><secondary-title>PLOS Computational Biology</secondary-title><short-title>Machine Learning Meta-analysis of Large Metagenomic Datasets</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS Computational Biology</full-title><abbr-1>PLOS Computational Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e1004977</pages><volume>12</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Cirrhosis</keyword><keyword>Forecasting</keyword><keyword>Machine learning</keyword><keyword>Metagenomics</keyword><keyword>Microbiome</keyword><keyword>Obesity</keyword><keyword>Species diversity</keyword><keyword>Type 2 diabetes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>Jul 11, 2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1553-7358</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004977</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the human associated microbiome provides a rich set of microbial features for prediction and biomarker discovery in the context of human diseases and health conditions. However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the “healthy” microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis. The software framework, microbiome profiles, and metadata for thousands of samples are publicly available at http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaml.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004977</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\ILM5ATJF\Pasolli et al. - 2016 - Machine Learning Meta-analysis of Large Metagenomi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\JH8IRRST\article.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-08-15 15:27:41</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Franzosa, E.

Here we present MetaTrans, an efficient open-source pipeline to analyze the structure and functions of active microbial communities using the power of multi-threading computers. The pipeline is designed to perform two types of RNA-Seq analyses: taxonomic and gene expression. It performs quality-control assessment, rRNA removal, maps reads against functional databases and also handles differential gene expression analysis. Its efficacy was validated by analyzing data from synthetic mock communities, data from a previous study and data generated from twelve human fecal samples. Compared to an existing web application server, MetaTrans shows more efficiency in terms of runtime (around 2 hours per million of transcripts) and presents adapted tools to compare gene expression levels. It has been tested with a human gut microbiome database but also proposes an option to use a general database in order to analyze other ecosystems. For the installation and use of the pipeline, we provide a detailed guide at the following website (www.metatrans.org).</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep26447</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\JTR9ZEFB\Martinez et al. - 2016 - MetaTrans an open-source pipeline for metatranscr.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\HSBCETHT\srep26447.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-08-15 15:32:09</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tamames, Javier</author><author>Puente-Sánchez, Fernando</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SqueezeMeta, A Highly Portable, Fully Automatic Metagenomic Analysis Pipeline</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Microbiology</full-title><abbr-1>Front.

Bioinformatic analysis of sequencing results poses a challenge because this involves many different complex steps. SqueezeMeta is a fully automatic pipeline for metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, covering all steps of the analysis. SqueezeMeta includes multi-metagenome support that enables co-assembly of related metagenomes and retrieval of individual genomes via binning procedures. SqueezeMeta features several unique characteristics: co-assembly procedure or co-assembly of unlimited number of metagenomes via merging of individual assembled metagenomes, both with read mapping for estimation of the abundances of genes in each metagenome. It also includes binning and bin checking for retrieving individual genomes. Internal checks for the assembly and binning steps provide information about the consistency of contigs and bins. Moreover, results are stored in a mySQL database, where they can be easily exported and shared, and can be inspected anywhere using a flexible web interface that allows simple creation of complex queries. We illustrate the potential of SqueezeMeta by analyzing 32 gut metagenomes in a fully automatic way, enabling retrieval of several million genes and several hundreds of genomic bins. One of the motivations in the development of SqueezeMeta was producing a software capable of running in small desktop computers and thus amenable to all users and settings. We were also able to co-assemble two of these metagenomes and complete the full analysis in less than one day using a simple laptop computer. This reveals the capacity of SqueezeMeta to run without high-performance computing infrastructure. SqueezeMeta is a complete system covering all steps in the analysis of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes; it is capable of working even in scarce computational resources. It is therefore adequate for in-situ, real time analysis of metagenomes produced by nanopore sequencing.

However, little is known about the activity and hosts of ARGs in WWTPs. Here, we utilized both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches to comprehensively reveal the diversity, abundance, expression and hosts of ARGs in activated sludge (AS) from three conventional WWTPs in Taiwan. Based on deep sequencing data and a custom-made ARG database, a total of 360 ARGs associated with 24 classes of antibiotics were identified from the three AS metagenomes, with an abundance range of 7.06 × 10−1–1.20 × 10−4 copies of ARG/copy of 16S rRNA gene. Differential coverage binning analysis revealed that &gt;22 bacterial phyla were the putative hosts of the identified ARGs. Surprisingly, genus Mycobacterium and family Burkholderiaceae were observed as multi-drug resistant harboring 14 and 50 ARGs. Metatranscriptome analysis showed 65.8% of the identified ARGs were being expressed, highlighting that ARGs were not only present, but also transcriptionally active in AS. Remarkably, 110 identified ARGs were annotated as plasmid-associated and displayed a close to two-fold increased likelihood of being transcriptionally expressed compared to those ARGs found exclusively within bacterial chromosomes. Further analysis showed the transcript abundance of aminoglycoside, sulfonamide, and tetracycline resistance genes was mainly contributed by plasmid-borne ARGs. Our approach allowed us to specifically link ARGs to their transcripts and genetic context, providing a comprehensive insight into the prevalence, expression and hosts of ARGs in AS. Overall, results of this study enhance our understanding of the distribution and dissemination of ARGs in WWTPs, which benefits environmental risk assessment and management of ARB and ARGs.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019307603</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\TNIJUA5P\Liu et al. - 2019 - Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses reveal.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>C:\Users\defne\Zotero\storage\GFKWH8LU\S0160412019307603.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2019-08-15 15:39:47</access-date></record></records></xml>
